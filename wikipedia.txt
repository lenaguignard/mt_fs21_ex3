Estonia (; , ), officially the Republic of Estonia (, ), is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe.
It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland, to the west by the Baltic Sea, to the south by Latvia (343 km), and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia (338.6 km).
Across the Baltic Sea lies Sweden in the west and Finland in the north.
==History=====Prehistory===Human settlement in Estonia became possible 11,000 to 13,000 years ago, when the ice from the last glacial era melted.
According to radiocarbon dating it was settled around 11,000 years ago at the beginning of the ninth millennium BC.
Evidence has been found of hunting and fishing communities existing around 6500 BC near the town of Kunda in northern Estonia.
Bone and stone artefacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in Latvia, northern Lithuania and in southern Finland.
This is the only word of their language recorded from antiquity.
Their sailing vessels were called pirate ships by Henry of Livonia in his Latin chronicles written at the beginning of the 13th century.
Perhaps the most famous raid by Oeselian pirates occurred in 1187, with the attack on the Swedish town of Sigtuna by Finnic raiders from Couronia and Oesel.
The former was a warship, the latter mainly a merchant ship.
The superior god of Oeselians as described by Henry of Livonia was called Tharapita.
According to the legend in the chronicle Tharapita was born on a forested mountain in Virumaa (), mainland Estonia from where he flew to Oesel, Saaremaa The name Taarapita has been interpreted as "Taara, help!
He managed to assemble an army of 6,000 Estonian men from different counties, but he was killed during the Battle of St. Matthew's Day in September 1217.
The Duchy of Estonia was created out of the northern parts of the country and was a direct dominion of the King of Denmark from 1219 until 1346, when it was sold to the Teutonic Order and became part of the Ordenstaat.
In 1343, the people of northern Estonia and Saaremaa rebelled against German rule in the St. George's Night Uprising, which was put down by 1345.
Reval (known as Tallinn since 1918) gained Lübeck Rights in 1248 and joined an alliance of trading guilds called the Hanseatic League at the end of the thirteenth century.
After the decline of the Teutonic Order following its defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, and the defeat of the Livonian Order in the Battle of Swienta on 1 September 1435, the Livonian Confederation Agreement was signed on 4 December 1435.
Language, education, religion, and politics were transformed.
Church services were now conducted in the vernacular instead of in Latin, previously used.
During the Livonian War in 1561, northern Estonia submitted to Swedish control.
In 1629, mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule.
This division persisted until the early twentieth century.
In 1632, a printing press and university were established in the city of Dorpat (known as Tartu since 1918).
This period is known in Estonian history as "the Good Old Swedish Time.
"The population of Estonia increased steadily until the outbreak of the plague in 1657.
During the Great Famine of 1695–97 some 70,000 people perished – almost 20% of the population.
The war devastated the population of Estonia, but it recovered quickly.
Among the leaders of the movement were Johann Voldemar Jannsen, Jakob Hurt and Carl Robert Jakobson.
In response to a period of Russification initiated by the Russian Empire in the 1890s, Estonian nationalism took on more political tones, with intellectuals first calling for greater autonomy and, later, complete independence from the Russian Empire.
===Declaration of independence===Following the Bolshevik takeover of power in Russia after the October Revolution of 1917 and German victories against the Russian army, between the Russian Red Army's retreat and the arrival of advancing German troops, the Committee of Elders of the Maapäev issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence in Pärnu on 23 February and in Tallinn on 24 February 1918.
After winning the Estonian War of Independence against both Soviet Russia and the German Freikorps and "Baltische Landeswehr" volunteers, the Tartu Peace Treaty was signed on 2 February 1920.
The Republic of Estonia was recognised (de jure) by Finland on 7 July 1920, Poland on 31 December 1920, Argentina on 12 January 1921, by the Western Allies on 26 January 1921 and by India on 22 September 1921.
Initially a parliamentary democracy, the parliament (Riigikogu) was disbanded in 1934, following political unrest caused by the global economic crisis.
===World War II===The fate of Estonia in World War II was decided by the German–Soviet Nonaggression Pact and its of August 1939.
World War II began with the invasion and subsequent partition of an important regional ally of Estonia – Poland, by a joint operation of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
On 12 June 1940, the order for a total military blockade on Estonia was given to the Soviet Baltic Fleet.
The Red Army exited from their military bases in Estonia on 17 June.
Finally the military resistance was ended with negotiations and the Independent Signal Battalion surrendered and was disarmed.
There were two dead Estonian servicemen, Aleksei Männikus and Johannes Mandre, and several wounded on the Estonian side and about ten killed and more wounded on the Soviet side.
On 6 August 1940, Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union as the Estonian SSR.
Instead the vote to join the Soviet Union was taken by those elected in the elections held the previous month.
Repressive actions were also taken against thousands of ordinary people.
Political prisoners who could not be evacuated were executed by the NKVD.
Contemporary Russian politicians deny that the Republic of Estonia was illegally annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
They state that the Soviet troops had entered Estonia in 1940 following the agreement and with the consent of the government of the Republic of Estonia, regardless of how their actions can be interpreted today.
They maintain that the USSR was not in a state of war and was not waging any combat activities on the territory of Estonia; therefore there could be no occupation.
The Red Army retreated behind the Pärnu River – Emajõgi line on 12 July.
After the Soviets were driven out from Estonia, German troops disarmed all the partisan groups.
The Germans used Estonia's resources for their war effort; for the duration of the occupation Estonia was incorporated into the German province of Ostland.
===Soviet Estonia===The Soviet forces reconquered Estonia in the autumn of 1944 after battles in the northeast of the country on the Narva river, on the Tannenberg Line (Sinimäed), in Southeast Estonia, on the Emajõgi river, and in the West Estonian Archipelago.
In the face of the country being re-occupied by the Red Army, tens of thousands of Estonians (including a majority of the education, culture, science, political and social specialists) (estimates as many as 80,000) chose to either retreat with the Germans or flee to Finland or Sweden.
More than 10% of the entire adult Baltic population was deported or sent to Soviet labour camps.
After World War II, as part of the goal to more fully integrate Baltic countries into the Soviet Union, mass deportations were conducted in the Baltic countries and the policy of encouraging Soviet immigration to the Baltic states continued.
In addition to the human and material losses suffered due to war, thousands of civilians were killed and tens of thousands of people deported from Estonia by the Soviet authorities until Joseph Stalin's death in 1953.
Half the deported perished, and the other half were not allowed to return until the early 1960s (years after Stalin's death).
This conflict continued into the early 1950s.
Material damage caused by the world war and the following Soviet era significantly slowed Estonia's economic growth, resulting in a wide wealth gap in comparison with neighbouring Finland and Sweden.
Militarization was another aspect of the Soviet state.
Large parts of the country, especially the coastal areas, were closed to all but the Soviet military.
People not actually residing there were restricted from travelling to them without a permit.
A notable closed military installation was the city of Paldiski, which was entirely closed to all public access.
The city had a support base for the Soviet Baltic Fleet's submarines and several large military bases, including a nuclear submarine training centre complete with a full-scale model of a nuclear submarine with working nuclear reactors.
The Paldiski reactors building passed into Estonian control in 1994 after the last Russian troops left the country.
Immigration was another effect of Soviet occupation.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants were relocated to Estonia from other parts of the Soviet Union to assist industrialisation and militarisation, contributing an increase of about half a million people within 45 years.
Estonia's return to independence became possible as the Soviet Union faced internal regime challenges, loosening its hold on the outer empire.
As the 1980s progressed, a movement for Estonian autonomy started.
The 2004 enlargement of the European Union was the largest single expansion of the European Union, both in terms of territory and population, but not in terms of gross domestic product (wealth).
Estonia was among a group of ten countries admitted to the EU on 1 May 2004.
The Treaty of Accession 2003 was signed on 16 April 2003.
The Estonian political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1992 constitutional document.
===Government===The Government of Estonia () or the executive branch is formed by the Prime Minister of Estonia, nominated by the president and approved by the parliament.
The prime minister also has the right to appoint other ministers and assign them a subject to deal with.
The prime minister has the right to appoint a maximum of three such ministers, as the limit of ministers in one government is fifteen.
It is also known as the cabinet.
The government, headed by the prime minister, thus represents the political leadership of the country and makes decisions in the name of the whole executive power.
Internet voting is used in elections in Estonia.
The first internet voting took place in the 2005 local elections and the first in a parliamentary election was made available for the 2007 elections, in which 30,275 individuals voted over the internet.
Voters have a chance to invalidate their electronic vote in traditional elections, if they wish to.
===Law===According to the Constitution of Estonia () the supreme power of the state is vested in the people.
The people exercise their supreme power of the state on the elections of the Riigikogu through citizens who have the right to vote.
The supreme judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court or Riigikohus, with nineteen justices.
The president, however, does not use these rights very often, having a largely ceremonial role.
He or she is elected by Riigikogu, with two-thirds of the votes required.
As in other spheres, Estonian law-making has been successfully integrated with the Information Age.
===Foreign relations===Estonia was a member of the League of Nations from 22 September 1921, has been a member of the United Nations since 17 September 1991, and of NATO since 29 March 2004, as well as the European Union since 1 May 2004.
Estonia has also signed the Kyoto Protocol.
Indeed, Estonians consider themselves a Nordic people rather than Balts, based on their historical ties with Sweden, Denmark and particularly Finland.
In 2005, Estonia joined the European Union's Nordic Battle Group.
Whereas in 1992 Russia accounted for 92% of Estonia's international trade, today there is extensive economic interdependence between Estonia and its Nordic neighbours: three quarters of foreign investment in Estonia originates in the Nordic countries (principally Finland and Sweden), to which Estonia sends 42% of its exports (as compared to 6.5% going to Russia, 8.8% to Latvia, and 4.7% to Lithuania).
On the other hand, the Estonian political system, its flat rate of income tax, and its non-welfare-state model distinguish it from the Nordic countries and their Nordic model, and indeed from many other European countries.
===Military===The military of Estonia is based upon the Estonian Defence Forces (), which is the name of the unified armed forces of the republic with "Maavägi" (Army), "Merevägi" (Navy), "Õhuvägi" (Air Force) and a paramilitary national guard organisation "Kaitseliit" (Defence League).
The current national military service () is compulsory for men between 18 and 28, and conscripts serve eight-month to eleven-month tours of duty depending on the army branch they serve in.
In 2008, annual military spending reached 1.85% of GDP, or 5 billion kroons, and was expected to continue to increase until 2010, when a 2.0% level was anticipated.
The Estonian Defence Forces have also previously had military missions in Croatia from March until October 1995, in Lebanon from December 1996 until June 1997 and in Macedonia from May until December 2003.
Estonia participates in the Nordic Battlegroup and has announced readiness to send soldiers also to Sudan to Darfur if necessary, creating the very first African peacekeeping mission for the armed forces of Estonia.
In 2007, a military doctrine of an e-military of Estonia was officially introduced as the country was under massive cyberattacks in 2007.
The main cyber warfare facility is the Computer Emergency Response Team of Estonia (CERT), founded in 2006.
The organisation operates on security issues in local networks.
==Economy==As a member of the European Union, Estonia is considered a high-income economy by the World Bank.
The country is ranked 11th in the 2014 Index of Economic Freedom, and the 4th freest economy in Europe.
The unemployment rate is around 11.7%, which is above the EU average, while real GDP growth in 2011 was 8.0%, five times the euro-zone average.
In 2012, Estonia remained the only euro member with a budget surplus, and with a national debt of only 6%, it is one of the least indebted countries in Europe.
Trade focused on the local market and the West, particularly Germany and the United Kingdom.
Only 3% of all commerce was with the USSR.
Before the Second World War Estonia was mainly an agricultural country whose products such as butter, milk and cheese were widely known on the western European markets.
Estonia's market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the former COMECON area.
In 1994, based on the economic theories of Milton Friedman, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a flat tax, with a uniform rate of 26% regardless of personal income.
In January 2005, the personal income tax rate was reduced to 24%.
The income tax rate was decreased to 21% by January 2008.
In 1999, Estonia experienced its worst year economically since it regained independence in 1991, largely because of the impact of the 1998 Russian financial crisis.
Estonia joined the WTO in November 1999.
With assistance from the European Union, the World Bank and the Nordic Investment Bank, Estonia completed most of its preparations for European Union membership by the end of 2002 and now has one of the strongest economies of the new member states of the European Union.
Estonia joined the OECD in 2010.
The country has large oil shale and limestone deposits, along with forests that cover 48% of the land.
In addition to oil shale and limestone, Estonia also has large reserves of phosphorite, pitchblende, and granite that currently are not mined, or not mined extensively.
The country currently exports around 3000 tonnes per annum, representing around 2% of world production.
In recent years, public debate has discussed whether Estonia should build a nuclear power plant to secure energy production after closure of old units in the Narva Power Plants, if they are not reconstructed by the year 2016.
In 2007, the construction industry employed more than 80,000 people, around 12% of the entire country's workforce.
Another important industrial sector is the machinery and chemical industry, which is mainly located in Ida-Viru County and around Tallinn.
The oil shale based mining industry, which is also concentrated in East-Estonia, produces around 90% of the entire country's electricity.
Although the amount of pollutants emitted to the air have been falling since the 1980s, the air is still polluted with sulphur dioxide from the mining industry that the Soviet Union rapidly developed in the early 1950s.
In some areas the coastal seawater is polluted, mainly around the Sillamäe industrial complex.
Estonia is a dependent country in the terms of energy and energy production.
In recent years many local and foreign companies have been investing in renewable energy sources.
The importance of wind power has been increasing steadily in Estonia and currently the total amount of energy production from wind is nearly 60 MW while at the same time roughly 399 MW worth of projects are currently being developed and more than 2800 MW worth of projects are being proposed in the Lake Peipus area and the coastal areas of Hiiumaa.
Currently, there are plans to renovate some older units of the Narva Power Plants, establish new power stations, and provide higher efficiency in oil shale based energy production.
Estonia liberalised 35% of its electricity market in April 2010.
The electricity market as whole will be liberalised by 2013.
Estonia has a strong information technology sector, partly owing to the Tiigrihüpe project undertaken in mid-1990s, and has been mentioned as the most "wired" and advanced country in Europe in the terms of e-Government of Estonia.
Skype was written by Estonia-based developers Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu, and Jaan Tallinn, who had also originally developed Kazaa.
===Trade===Estonia has had a market economy since the end of the 1990s and one of the highest per capita income levels in Eastern Europe.
The current government has pursued tight fiscal policies, resulting in balanced budgets and low public debt.
The oldest university is the University of Tartu, established by the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf in 1632.
In 1919, university courses were first taught in the Estonian language.
Today's education in Estonia is divided into general, vocational, and hobby.
The education system is based on four levels: pre-school, basic, secondary, and higher education.
A wide network of schools and supporting educational institutions have been established.
The Estonian education system consists of state, municipal, public, and private institutions.
There are currently 589 schools in Estonia.
===Sports===Sport plays an important role in Estonian culture.
After declaring independence from Russia in 1918, Estonia first competed as a nation at the 1920 Summer Olympics, although the National Olympic Committee was established in 1923.
Estonian athletes took part of the Olympic Games until the country was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
After regaining independence in 1991, Estonia has participated in all Olympics.

In 1831, the Ottomans managed to overthrow the Mamluk regime and imposed their direct control over Iraq.
The population of Iraq, estimated at 30 million in 800 AD, was only 5 million at the start of the 20th century.
The British lost 92,000 soldiers in the Mesopotamian campaign.
King Ghazi ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939.

===Foreign relations===On November 17, 2008, the U.S. and Iraq agreed to a Status of Forces Agreement, as part of the broader Strategic Framework Agreement.
On 12 February 2009, Iraq officially became the 186th State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Under the provisions of this treaty, Iraq is considered a party with declared stockpiles of chemical weapons.
Because of their late accession, Iraq is the only State Party exempt from the existing timeline for destruction of their chemical weapons.
Specific criteria is in development to address the unique nature of Iraqi accession.
A conflict occurred in December 2009, when Iraq accused Iran of seizing an oil well on the border.
Relationships with Turkey are tense, largely because of the Kurdistan Regional Government, as clashes between Turkey and the PKK continue.
In October 2011, the Turkish parliament renewed a law that gives Turkish forces the ability to pursue rebels over the border in Iraq.
Furthermore, Kurdish is now an official language of Iraq alongside Arabic according to Article 4 of the constitution.
LGBT rights in Iraq remain limited.
Targeting people because of their gender identity or sexual orientation is not uncommon and is usually carried out in the name of family honor.
Iraq's population was estimated at only 2 million in 1878.
Iraq's population as announced by the government has reached 35 million amid a post-war population boom.
According to the Central Intelligence Agency, Arabs form 75%–80% of the population.
15% of Iraq's population are Kurds.
Around 20,000 Marsh Arabs live in southern Iraq.
Iraq also has a community of 2,500 Chechens.
In southern Iraq there is a community of Iraqis of African descent, a legacy of the slavery practiced in the Islamic Caliphate beginning before the Zanj Rebellion of the 9th century, and Basra's role as a key port.
Prior to the invasion in 2003, Arabic was the sole official language.
In 2007, the U.N. said that about 40% of Iraq's middle class is believed to have fled and that most are fleeing systematic persecution and have no desire to return.

In these cities are found fragments of several great buildings which seem to have been palace-temples.
They were constructed chiefly of sun-dried bricks, and all that remains of them is the lower part of the walls, decorated with sculpture and paintings, portions of the pavements, a few indications of the elevation, and some interesting works connected with the drainage.
Nonetheless, foreign "mujahideen" volunteers came from 43 countries, and the total number that participated in the Afghan movement between 1982 and 1992 is reported to have been 35,000.
One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda, formed by bin Laden with an initial meeting held on August 11, 1988.
In 1991, Ali Mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin Laden's relocation to Sudan.
In June 1995, an even more ill-fated attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Mubarak led to the expulsion of EIJ, and in May 1996, of bin Laden, by the Sudanese government.
The bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, Operation Restore Hope.
===1993 World Trade Center bombing===In 1993, Ramzi Yousef used a truck bomb to attack the World Trade Center in New York City.
Yousef hoped this would kill 250,000 people.
In December 2004 an audio message claiming to be from bin Laden was posted directly to a website, rather than sending a copy to al Jazeera as he had done in the past.
Bin Laden's December 2004 message was much more vehement than usual in this speech, lasting over an hour.
In the past, Alneda.com and Jehad.net were perhaps the most significant al-Qaeda websites.
Ahmad's extradition is opposed by various British Muslim organizations, such as the Muslim Association of Britain.

Israel or , officially the State of Israel (, , ; , , ), is a country in Western Asia, situated at the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
Since the establishment of the State in 1948, and particularly since the late 1970s, an Israeli fusion cuisine has developed.
From 1912 to 1927, the territory of Libya was known as Italian North Africa.
From 1927 to 1934, the territory was split into two colonies, Italian Cyrenaica and Italian Tripolitania, run by Italian governors.
Some 150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting roughly 20% of the total population.
In 1934, Italy adopted the name "Libya" (used by the Ancient Greeks for all of North Africa, except Egypt) as the official name of the colony (made up of the three provinces of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan).
In 1944, Idris returned from exile in Cairo but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal of some aspects of foreign control in 1947.
Under the terms of the 1947 peace treaty with the Allies, Italy relinquished all claims to Libya.
===Independence, Kingdom of Libya and Libya under Gaddafi===On 24 December 1951, Libya declared its independence as the United Kingdom of Libya, a constitutional and hereditary monarchy under King Idris, Libya's only monarch.
Gaddafi was referred to as the "Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution" in government statements and the official Libyan press.
In February 1977, Libya started delivering military supplies to Goukouni Oueddei and the People's Armed Forces in Chad.
Hundreds of Libyans lost their lives in the war against Tanzania, when Gaddafi tried to save his friend Idi Amin.
From 1977 onward, per capita income in the country rose to more than US $11,000, the fifth-highest in Africa, while the Human Development Index became the highest in Africa and greater than that of Saudi Arabia.
The Great Manmade River was also built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country.
In addition, financial support was provided for university scholarships and employment programs.
Libya was finally put under United Nations sanctions after the bombing of a commercial flight killed hundreds of travellers.
On 7 July 2012, Libyans had voted in their first parliamentary elections since the end of the former regime.
It is currently being re-established by the Libyan government, as Libya's previous national army was defeated in the Libyan Civil War and disbanded.
As of November 2012, it was deemed to be still in the embryonic stage of development.
The government was also friendly towards Western countries such as the United Kingdom, United States, France, Italy, Greece, and established full diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1955.
The Kingdom was noted for its close association with the West, while it steered a conservative course at home.
After the 1969 coup, Muammar Gaddafi closed American and British bases and partly nationalized foreign oil and commercial interests in Libya.
Relations with the West were strained by a series of incidents for most of Gaddafi's rule, including the killing of London policewoman Yvonne Fletcher, the bombing of a West Berlin nightclub frequented by U.S. servicemen, and the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which led to UN sanctions in the 1990s, though by the late 2000s, the United States and other Western powers had normalised relations with Libya.
Gaddafi's decision to abandon the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction after the Iraq War saw Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein overthrown and put on trial led to Libya being hailed as a success for Western soft power initiatives in the War on Terror.
In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders on behalf of Arab nations for their involvement in the African slave trade.
A large number of Libyan television stations are devoted to political review, Islamic topics and cultural phenomena.
A number of TV stations air various styles of traditional Libyan music.
Tuareg music and dance are popular in Ghadames and the south.
A 1996 analysis by the Committee to Protect Journalists found Libya’s media was the most tightly controlled in the Arab world during the country's dictatorship.
However as of 2012 hundreds of TV stations have begun to air due to the collapse of censorship from the old regime and the initiation of "free media".
Common Libyan foods include several variations of red (tomato) sauce based pasta dishes (similar to the Italian Sugo all'arrabbiata dish); rice, usually served with lamb or chicken (typically stewed, fried, grilled, or boiled in-sauce); and couscous, which is steam cooked whilst held over boiling red (tomato) sauce and meat (sometimes also containing courgettes/zucchini and chickpeas), which is typically served along with cucumber slices, lettuce and olives.
Kepler was the first to devise a system that described correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center.
Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.
The distance to a star was first announced in 1838 when the parallax of 61 Cygni was measured by Friedrich Bessel.
Although some radio waves are produced by astronomical objects in the form of thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed from Earth is the result of synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields.
===Optical astronomy===Historically, optical astronomy, also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of astronomy.
In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment.
The Maunder minimum, for example, is believed to have caused the Little Ice Age phenomenon during the Middle Ages.
The Solar System is subdivided into the inner planets, the asteroid belt, and the outer planets.
The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, and finally the Oort Cloud, which may extend as far as a light-year.
It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction.
As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.
Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded over the course of 13.8 billion years to its present condition.
The concept of the big bang can be traced back to the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965.
In the course of this expansion, the universe underwent several evolutionary stages.
In the very early moments, it is theorized that the universe experienced a very rapid cosmic inflation, which homogenized the starting conditions.
(See also nucleocosmochronology.
Fundamental to the structure of the universe is the existence of dark matter and dark energy.
These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the universe.
For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.
In academia, he is known for his analysis of international relations and the introduction of Islam to the study of international conflict and of civilization.
A few months later, at the age of 75, Nizar Qabbani died in London on 30 April 1998 of a heart attack.
The Moon is the second densest satellite in the Solar System after Io.
However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about or less, around 20% of the radius of the Moon.
The lunar far side is on average about higher than the near side.
Maria are found almost exclusively on the near side of the Moon, covering 31% of the surface on the near side, compared with a few scattered patches on the far side covering only 2%.
In 2008, an analysis of volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water to exist in the interior of the beads.
However, because Earth is moving in its orbit around the Sun at the same time, it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5 days (its synodic period).
It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, though Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto, at 1/9 Pluto's mass.
Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun.
The Moon does appear larger when close to the horizon, but this is a purely psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion, first described in the 7th century BC.
This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°.
Because Earth spins about 27 times faster than the Moon moves around it, the bulges are dragged along with Earth's surface faster than the Moon moves, rotating around Earth once a day as it spins on its axis.
The ocean tides are magnified by other effects: frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors, the inertia of water's movement, ocean basins that get shallower near land, and oscillations between different ocean basins.
In turn, angular momentum is added to the Moon's orbit, accelerating it, which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit with a longer period.
As a result, the distance between Earth and Moon is increasing, and Earth's spin slowing down.
Libration also changes the angle from which the Moon is seen, allowing about 59% of its surface to be seen from Earth (but only half at any instant).
The subsequent landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the Space Race.
Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon as the commander of the American mission Apollo 11 by first setting foot on the Moon at 02:56 UTC on 21 July 1969.

When not dressed in western clothing such as jeans and T-shirts, men typically wear the "macawiis", which is a sarong-like garment worn around the waist.
In March 2008, the first Catholic Church in Doha, Our Lady of the Rosary, was opened.
Referendums were held on all four of the islands.
At this time, the population of Mayotte voted against independence from France in two referenda.
The first, held in December 1974, won 63.8% support for maintaining ties with France, while the second, held in February 1976, confirmed that vote with an overwhelming 99.4%.
A few days later, Bob Denard was evacuated to South Africa by French paratroopers.
He led the country from 1996, during a time of labor crises, government suppression, and secessionist conflicts, until his death November 1998.
Azali stepped down in 2002 to run in the democratic election of the President of the Comoros, which he won.
Under ongoing international pressure, as a military ruler who had originally come to power by force, and was not always democratic while in office, Azali led the Comoros through constitutional changes that enabled new elections.
A "Loi des compétences" law was passed in early 2005 that defines the responsibilities of each governmental body, and is in the process of implementation.
Some rebels were killed and injured, but there are no official figures.
The presidency of the Union rotates between the islands.
The judiciary is independent of the legislative and the executive.
The Supreme Court acts as a Constitutional Council in resolving constitutional questions and supervising presidential elections.
As High Court of Justice, the Supreme Court also arbitrates in cases where the government is accused of malpractice.
More recently, the Assembly has maintained this item on its agenda but deferred it from year to year without taking action.
Comoros is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, the European Development Fund, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Indian Ocean Commission and the African Development Bank.
On 10 April 2008, Comoros became the 179th nation to accept the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the economy, and 38.4% of the working population is employed in the primary sector.
High population densities, as much as 1000 per square kilometer in the densest agricultural zones, for what is still a mostly rural, agricultural economy may lead to an environmental crisis in the near future, especially considering the high rate of population growth.
The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance.
Agriculture contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.
The government is struggling to upgrade education and technical training, to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify exports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth rate.
In 2001, 34% of the population was considered urban, but that is expected to grow, since rural population growth is negative, while overall population growth is still relatively high.
For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus.
==Formation and evolution==The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.
Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.
The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the inner Solar System and causes the zodiacal light.
==Galactic context==The Solar System is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter of about 100,000 light-years containing about 200 billion stars.
The stars next closest to the Sun are the red dwarfs Barnard's Star (at 5.9 light years), Wolf 359 (7.8 light years), and Lalande 21185 (8.3 light years).
== History of religious texts ==The oldest known religious texts are the Pyramid Texts of Ancient Egypt that date to 2400-2300 BCE.
London: SOAS.
Ordinance 83.127, enacted 5 June 1983, started the process of nationalization of all land not clearly the property of a documented owner, thus abolishing the traditional system of land tenure.
Potential nationalization was based on the concept of "dead land", i.e., property which has not been developed or on which obvious development cannot be seen.
A practical effect was government seizure of traditional communal grazing lands.
Political parties, illegal during the military period, were legalized again in 1991.
By April 1992, as civilian rule returned, 16 major political parties had been recognized; 12 major political parties were active in 2004.
President Taya won elections in 1992 and 1997.
Most opposition parties boycotted the first legislative election in 1992.
For nearly a decade the parliament was dominated by the PRDS.
The opposition participated in municipal elections in January–February 1994, and in subsequent Senate elections – most recently in April 2004 – and gained representation at the local level, as well as three seats in the Senate.
This period was marked by extensive ethnic violence and human rights abuses.
The slaves were mostly black.
The rioting, added to already existing tensions, led to a campaign within the country of terror against black Mauritanians, who are often seen as 'Senegalese' by Beidanes, regardless of their nationality.
The war culminated in an international airlift agreed to by Senegal and Mauritania under international pressure to prevent further violence.
The Mauritanian Government expelled tens of thousands of black Mauritanians.
Most of these so-called 'Senegalese' had no ties to Senegal, and many still reside in refugee camps in Mali and Senegal.
The exact number of expulsions is not known but the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that, as of June 1991, 52,995 Mauritanian refugees were living in Senegal and at least 13,000 in Mali.
From November 1990 to February 1991, between 500 and 600 Fula and Soninke political prisoners were executed or tortured to death by Mauritanian government forces.
The government initiated a military investigation but never released the results.
In order to guarantee immunity for those responsible and to block any attempts at accountability for past abuses, the Parliament declared an amnesty in June 1993 covering all crimes committed by the armed forces, security forces as well as civilians, between April 1989 and April 1992.
The government offered compensation to families of victims, which a few accepted in lieu of settlement.
During the mid-to late 1990s, Mauritania shifted its foreign policy to one of increased co-operation with the US and Europe.
It was rewarded with diplomatic normalization and aid projects.
On 28 October 1999, Mauritania joined Egypt, Palestine, and Jordan as the only members of the Arab League to officially recognize Israel.
Ould Taya also started co-operating with the United States in anti-terrorism activities, a policy which was criticized by some human rights organizations.
(See also Foreign relations of Mauritania.
Parliamentary and municipal elections in Mauritania took place on 19 November and 3 December 2006.
===2007 presidential election===Mauritania's first fully democratic presidential election took place on 11 March 2007.
The election effected the final transfer from military to civilian rule following the military coup in 2005.
This was the first time since Mauritania gained independence in 1960 that it elected a president in a multi-candidate election.
The army surrounded key government facilities, including the state television building, after the president fired senior officers, one of them the head of the presidential guards.
He had recently been fired.
It found few supporters (among them Morocco, Libya and Iran), while Algeria, the United States, France and other European countries criticized the coup, and continued to refer to Abdallahi as the legitimate president of Mauritania.
The new government broke off relations with Israel.
During the spring of 2009, the junta negotiated an understanding with some opposition figures and international parties.
Abdallahi's resignation allowed the election of Abdel Aziz as civilian president, on 18 July, by a 52% majority.
In February 2011, the waves of the Arab Spring spread to Mauritania, where hundreds of people took to the streets of the capital.
Following the 2008 coup, the military government of Mauritania faced severe international sanctions and internal unrest.
These ethnic groups have been seen to contest the political, economic, and social dominance of Moors.
Armed groups such as the now-exiled FLAM have carried out low-level rebellions in the southern part of Mauritania because of these continuing discriminatory practices.
Though slavery was abolished in 1981, it was not illegal to own slaves until 2007.
In 2012, it was estimated that 10% to 20% of the population of Mauritania (between 340,000 and 680,000 people) live in slavery.

The names of at least six daughters are known, and while they played significant roles behind the scenes during his lifetime, no documents have survived that definitively provide the number or names of daughters born to the consorts of Genghis Khan.
As early as the 10th century, the identity and exact corpus of works of Jābir was in dispute in Islamic circles.
This work enjoyed a great reputation during the Middle Ages.
Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, "Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.
Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects.
In the first years of World War II, the British authorities asked Haganah for cooperation again, due to the fear of an Axis breakthrough in North Africa.
The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year.
In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the Rome–Berlin Axis.
A month later, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy would join in the following year.
The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, bargained with both sides during the Second World War, but never concluded any major agreements.
On 23 August Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that Britain had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.
Austria is one of the richest countries in the world, with a nominal per capita GDP of $52,216 (2014 est.).
The country has developed a high standard of living and in 2011 was ranked 19th in the world for its Human Development Index.
Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955, joined the European Union in 1995, and is a founder of the OECD.
Austria was a prefecture of Bavaria created in 976.
The word "Austria" is a Latinisation of the German name and was first recorded in the 12th century.
At the time, the Danube basin of Austria (Upper and Lower Austria) was the easternmost extent of Bavaria, and in fact of all the Germans, as at the time the territory of the former East Germany was populated by Slavic Sorbs and Polabians.
The Celtic name was eventually Latinised to "Noricum" after the Romans conquered the area that encloses most of modern day Austria, in around 15 BC.
In 1156 the Privilegium Minus elevated Austria to the status of a duchy.
In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of Styria.
His reign came to an end with his defeat at Dürnkrut at the hands of Rudolph I of Germany in 1278.
Thereafter, until World War I, Austria's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the Habsburgs.
Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, henceforth every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.
Ottoman expansion into Hungary led to frequent conflicts between the two empires, particularly evident in the so-called Long War of 1593 to 1606.
With the rise of Prussia the Austrian–Prussian dualism began in Germany.
Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three Partitions of Poland (in 1772 and 1795).
Two years earlier, in 1804, the Empire of Austria was founded.
In 1814 Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the Napoleonic Wars.
It emerged from the Congress of Vienna in 1815 as one of the continent's four dominant powers and a recognised great power.
The same year, the German Confederation () was founded under the presidency of Austria.
Because of unsolved social, political and national conflicts the German lands were shaken by the 1848 revolution aiming to create a unified Germany.
A unified Germany would have been possible either as a Greater Germany, or a Greater Austria or just the German Confederation without Austria at all.
As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the German Empire of 1848, the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV.
In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against Denmark and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein.
But as they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, they fought the Austro-Prussian War in 1866.
Defeated by Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz, Austria had to leave the German Confederation and subsequently no longer took part in German politics.
As a result, ruling Austria–Hungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements, requiring considerable reliance on an expanded secret police.
Yet the government of Austria tried its best to be accommodating in some respects: The "Reichsgesetzblatt", publishing the laws and ordinances of Cisleithania, was issued in eight languages; and all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices, for example.
Over one million Austro-Hungarian soldiers died in World War I.
This new government was invited by the Emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with Italy, but refrained from this business.
This left the responsibility for the end of the war, on 3 November 1918, solely to the Emperor and his government.
On 11 November the emperor, advised by ministers of the old and the new government, declared he would not take part in state business any more; on 12 November German Austria, by law, declared itself to be a democratic republic and part of the new German republic.
The Treaty of Saint-Germain of 1919 (for Hungary the Treaty of Trianon of 1920) confirmed and consolidated the new order of Central Europe which to a great extent had been established in November 1918, creating new states and altering others.
These included the provinces of South Tyrol (which became part of Italy) and German Bohemia (Czechoslovakia).
The status of South Tyrol was a lingering problem between Austria and Italy until it was officially settled by the 1980s with a great degree of autonomy being granted to it by the Italian national government.
Between 1918 and 1919 Austria was known as the State of German Austria ().
Not only did the Entente powers forbid German Austria to unite with Germany, they also rejected the name German Austria in the peace treaty to be signed; it was therefore changed to Republic of Austria in late 1919.
The border between Austria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) was settled with the Carinthian Plebiscite in October 1920 and allocated the major part of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Crownland of Carinthia to Austria.
This set the border on the Karawanken mountain range, with many Slovenes remaining in Austria.
In autumn 1922 Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the League of Nations.
The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency and improve Austria's general economic condition.
The loan meant that Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations.
Later it was called the Alpine dollar due to its stability.
From 1925 to 1929 the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after Black Friday.
On 1 May 1934, the Austrofascists imposed a new constitution ("Maiverfassung") which cemented Dollfuss's power but on 25 July he was assassinated in a Nazi coup attempt.
His successor Kurt Schuschnigg struggled to keep Austria independent as "the better German state", but on 12 March 1938, Austrian Nazis took over government, while German troops occupied the country.
On 13 March 1938, the "Anschluss" of Austria was officially declared.
Parliamentary elections were held in Germany (including recently annexed Austria) on 10 April 1938.
Turnout in the election was officially 99.5% with 98.9% voting "yes".
In the case of Austria, Hitler's native soil, 99.71% of an electorate of 4,484,475 officially went to the ballots, with a positive tally of 99.73%.
Vienna fell on 13 April 1945, during the Soviet Vienna Offensive just before the total collapse of the Third Reich.
However it never materialized because of the rapid collapse of the Reich.
Karl Renner and Adolf Schärf (Socialist Party of Austria Democrats and Revolutionary Socialists), Leopold Kunschak (Austria's People's Party Christian Social People's Party) and Johann Koplenig (Communist Party of Austria) declared Austria's secession from the Third Reich by the Declaration of Independence on 27 April 1945 and set up a provisional government in Vienna under state Chancellor Renner the same day, with the approval of the victorious Red Army and backed by Joseph Stalin.
(The date is officially named the birthday of the second republic.
) At the end of April, most of Western and Southern Austria was still under Nazi rule.
On 1 May 1945, the federal constitution of 1929, which had been terminated by dictator Dollfuss on 1 May 1934, was declared valid again.
Thousands of Austrians had taken part in serious Nazi crimes (hundreds of thousands died in Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp alone), a fact officially recognised by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky in 1992.
As forecast in the Moscow Declaration in 1943, there was a subtle difference in the treatment of Austria by the Allies.
The Austrian government, consisting of Social Democrats, Conservatives and Communists (until 1947), and residing in Vienna, which was surrounded by the Soviet zone, was recognised by the Western Allies in October 1945 after some doubts that Renner could be Stalin's puppet.
Austria, in general, was treated as though it had been originally invaded by Germany and liberated by the Allies.
On 15 May 1955, after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the Cold War, Austria regained full independence by concluding the Austrian State Treaty with the Four Occupying Powers.
On 26 October 1955, after all occupation troops had left, Austria declared its "permanent neutrality" by an act of parliament.
During all other legislative periods, either a grand coalition of Conservatives and Social Democrats or a "small coalition" (one of these two and a smaller party) ruled the country.
Following a referendum in 1994, at which consent reached a majority of two-thirds, the country became a member of the European Union on 1 January 1995.
The major parties SPÖ and ÖVP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria's military non-alignment: While the SPÖ in public supports a neutral role, the ÖVP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy; even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some ÖVP politicians.
==Governance==The Parliament of Austria is located in Vienna, the country's largest city and capital.
Austria became a federal, parliamentary, democratic republic through the Federal Constitution of 1920.
The political system of the Second Republic with its nine states is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929, which was reenacted on 1 May 1945.
The chairman of the Federal Government is the Federal Chancellor, who is appointed by the president.
Voting for the federal president and for the Parliament used to be compulsory in Austria, but this was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004.
The composition of the Nationalrat (183 seats) is determined every five years (or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor, or by Nationalrat itself) by a general election in which every citizen over 16 years (since 2007) has voting rights.
While there is a general threshold of 4% for all parties at federal elections (Nationalratswahlen), there remains the possibility to gain a direct seat, or , in one of the 43 regional election districts.
The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria.
However, the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, has a limited right of veto (the Nationalrat can—in almost all cases—ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time.
Since 1995, the European Court of Justice may overrule Austrian decisions in all matters defined in laws of the European Union.
Austria also implements the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, since the European Convention on Human Rights is part of the Austrian constitution.
Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties.
This coalition broke up in June 2008.
Elections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties (Social Democrats and People's Party) but together they still held 70% of the votes, with the Social Democrats holding slightly more than the other party.
On 26 October 1955, the Federal Assembly passed a constitutional article in which "Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality".
The second section of this law stated that "in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory".
Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.
Austria began to reassess its definition of neutrality following the fall of the Soviet Union, granting overflight rights for the UN-sanctioned action against Iraq in 1991, and, since 1995, it has developed participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).
Also in 1995, it joined NATO's Partnership for Peace and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia.
Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is not to allow foreign military bases in Austria.
Austria attaches great importance to participation in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
In recent years, it has been discussed whether today it is appropriate for a small country to maintain ten parliaments.
==Economy==Austria is the 12th richest country in the world in terms of GDP (Gross domestic product) per capita, has a well-developed social market economy, and a high standard of living.
Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies.
Labour movements are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics.
Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the national economy.
Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the German economy.
Since Austria became a member state of the European Union, it has gained closer ties to other EU economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany.
Since the fall of communism, Austrian companies have been quite active players and consolidators in Eastern Europe.
Between 1995 and 2010, 4,868 mergers and acquisitions with a total known value of 163 bil.
EUR in 2005.
Tourism accounts for almost 9% of the Austrian gross domestic product.
In international tourist arrivals, Austria ranked 12th with 20.8 million tourists.
===Energy===In 1972, the country began construction of a nuclear-powered electricity-generation station at Zwentendorf on the River Danube, following a unanimous vote in parliament.
However, in 1978, a referendum voted approximately 50.5% against nuclear power, 49.5% for, and parliament subsequently unanimously passed a law forbidding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity.
Austria currently produces more than half of its electricity by hydropower.
Together with other renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and biomass powerplants, the electricity supply from renewable energy amounts to 62.89% of total use in Austria, with the rest being produced by gas and oil power plants.
It is known for its cultural offerings and high standard of living.
Vienna is by far the country's largest city.
All other cities have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.
According to Eurostat, in 2010 there were 1.27 million foreign-born residents in Austria, corresponding to 15.2% of the total population.
Of these, 764,000 (9.1%) were born outside the EU and 512,000 (6.1%) were born in another EU Member State.
Statistik Austria estimated in 2011 that 81% or 6.75 million residents had no migration background and more than 19% or 1.6 million inhabitants had at least one or more parents of migration background.
There are more than 415,000 descendants of foreign-born immigrants residing in Austria, the great majority of whom have been naturalized.
13,000 Turks were naturalized in 2003 and an unknown number have arrived in Austria at the same time.
While 2,000 Turks left Austria in the same year, 10,000 immigrated to the country, confirming a strong trend of growth.
The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2013 was estimated at 1.42 children born per woman, which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1.
In 2012, 41.5% of births were to unmarried women.
The life expectancy in 2013 was estimated at 80.04 years (77.13 years male, 83.1 years female).
The official language used in education, publications, announcements and websites is German, which is mostly identical to the German used in Germany but with some vocabulary differences.
The German language is standardized between countries of German mother tongue, i.e., Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxemburg and Liechtenstein, as well as those with significant German speaking minorities: Italy, Belgium and Denmark.
(The German population in Elsass-Lothringen in France has no minority rights.
) Many local dialects are spoken in Austria, and though their base is Austrian German, their corresponding speakers have certain degrees of difficulty when trying to understand each other.
Of the remaining number of Austria's people that are of non-Austrian descent, many come from surrounding countries, especially from the former East Bloc nations.
So-called guest workers "(Gastarbeiter)" and their descendants, as well as refugees from the Yugoslav wars and other conflicts, also form an important minority group in Austria.
Since 1994 the Roma–Sinti (gypsies) have been an officially recognised ethnic minority in Austria.
According to census information published by Statistik Austria for 2001 there were a total of 710,926 foreign nationals living in Austria.
Ludwig van Beethoven spent the better part of his life in Vienna.
Austria produced one notable jazz musician, keyboardist Josef Zawinul, who helped pioneer electronic influences in jazz as well as being a notable composer in his own right.
The drummer Thomas Lang was born in Vienna in 1967 and is now world renowned for his technical ability, having played with artists such as Geri Halliwell and Robbie Williams.
Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, Josef von Sternberg, and Fred Zinnemann originally came from Austria before establishing themselves as internationally relevant movie makers.
The first Austrian film director to receive an Academy Award was Stefan Ruzowitzky.
A number of Austrian actors were able to pursue a career, the impact of which was sensed beyond national borders.
Among them were Peter Lorre, Helmut Berger, Curd Jürgens, Senta Berger, Oskar Werner, and Klaus Maria Brandauer.
Hedy Lamarr and Arnold Schwarzenegger became American as well as international movie stars.
The latter also became the 38th Governor of California.
Christoph Waltz rose to international fame with his performance in "Inglourious Basterds", earning the Best Actor Award at Cannes in 2009, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2010 and finally two Oscars.
Otto Schenk not only excelled as a stage actor, but also as an opera director.
A present-day quantum physicist is Anton Zeilinger, noted as the first scientist to demonstrate quantum teleportation.
In addition to physicists, Austria was the birthplace of two of the most noteworthy philosophers of the 20th century, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper.
Eminent physicians like Theodore Billroth, Clemens von Pirquet, and Anton von Eiselsberg have built upon the achievements of the 19th century Vienna School of Medicine.
Austria was home to Sigmund Freud, founder of psychoanalysis, Alfred Adler, founder of Individual psychology, psychologists Paul Watzlawick and Hans Asperger, and psychiatrist Viktor Frankl.
===Literature===Complementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists.
It was the home of novelists Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Thomas Bernhard, and Robert Musil, of poets Georg Trakl, Franz Werfel, Franz Grillparzer, Rainer Maria Rilke, Adalbert Stifter, Karl Kraus and children's author Eva Ibbotson.
It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables.
Typical Austrian dishes include Wiener Schnitzel, Schweinsbraten, Kaiserschmarren, Knödel, Sachertorte and Tafelspitz.
There are also Kärntner Kasnudeln, which are pockets of dough filled with Topfen, potatoes, herbs and peppermint which are boiled and served with a butter sauce.
Kasnudeln are traditionally served with a salad.
The candy Pez was invented in Austria, as well as Mannerschnitten.
Austria is also famous for its Mozartkugeln and its coffee tradition.
At holidays like Christmas and Easter bock beer is also available.
The Grüner Veltliner grape provides some of Austria's most notable white wines and Zweigelt is the most widely planted red wine grape.
Schnapps of typically up to 60% alcohol or fruit brandy is drunk, which in Austria is made from a variety of fruits, for example apricots and rowanberries.
The produce of small private schnapps distilleries, of which there are around 20,000 in Austria, is known as "Selbstgebrannter" or "Hausbrand".
A popular team sport in Austria is football, which is governed by the Austrian Football Association.
Austria was among the most successful football playing nations on the European continent placing 4th at the 1934 FIFA World Cup, 3rd at the 1954 FIFA World Cup and 7th at the 1978 FIFA World Cup.
Besides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports, including the Austrian Hockey League for ice hockey, and the Österreichische Basketball Bundesliga for basketball.
Horseback riding is also popular; the famed Spanish Riding School of Vienna is located in Vienna.

==Origin==A precedent for trying those accused of war crimes had been set at the end of World War I in the Leipzig War Crimes Trials held in May to July 1921 before the "Reichsgericht" (German Supreme Court) in Leipzig, although these had been on a very limited scale and largely regarded as ineffectual.
British War Cabinet documents, released on 2 January 2006, showed that as early as December 1944, the Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured.
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had then advocated a policy of summary execution in some circumstances, with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles, being dissuaded from this only by talks with US and Soviet leaders later in the war.
US President Franklin D. Roosevelt joked that perhaps 49,000 would do.
However, he also stated that war criminals must pay for their crimes and that in accordance with the Moscow Document which he himself had written, they should be tried at the places where the crimes were committed.
Roosevelt initially supported this plan, and managed to convince Churchill to support it in a less drastic form.
The demise of the Morgenthau Plan created the need for an alternative method of dealing with the Nazi leadership.
The plan for the "Trial of European War Criminals" was drafted by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and the War Department.
Following Roosevelt's death in April 1945, the new president, Harry S. Truman, gave strong approval for a judicial process.
After a series of negotiations between Britain, the US, Soviet Union and France, details of the trial were worked out.
The trials were to commence on 20 November 1945, in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg.

The city was also provisional capital of the National Transitional Council.
===Education===The oldest university in Libya is the University of Libya, founded by royal decree in 1955.
It was later split and became known as University of Benghazi.
Béchar has a total of 33,245 houses, of which 25,499 are occupied, giving an occupation rate of 6.5 inhabitants per occupied building.
It is served by a narrow gauge railway station of SNTF, which in 2008, may be replaced with a standard gauge railway.
8.3% of the population has a tertiary education, and another 23.0% has competed secondary education.
The overall literacy rate is 86.4%, and is 91.4% among males and 81.4% among females.
A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 20 years, most recently for 2009 and 2010.
It is one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership in the Security Council.
Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors: with Russia over the South Kuril Islands, with South Korea over the Liancourt Rocks, with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands, and with China over the EEZ around Okinotorishima.
Japan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world.
Japan's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.
It is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF).
==Geography==Japan has a total of 6,852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of East Asia.
The Ryukyu Islands, which includes Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu.
Together they are often known as the Japanese Archipelago.
About 73 percent of Japan is forested, mountainous, and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential use.
As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities.
Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.
The islands of Japan are located in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire.
They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north.
Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent.
The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.
Japan has 108 active volcanoes.
The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.
More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.0-magnitude quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large tsunami.
===Environment===In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s.
Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970.
The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.
As a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference that created it, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.
The period of overall real economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s has been called the Japanese post-war economic miracle: it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s, and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s.
The economy showed strong signs of recovery after 2005; GDP growth for that year was 2.8 percent, surpassing the growth rates of the US and European Union during the same period.
, Japan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity.
, Japan's public debt was more than 200 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the second largest of any nation in the world.
Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.
Japan's exports amounted to US$4,210 per capita in 2005. , Japan's main export markets were China (18.1 percent), the United States (17.8 percent), South Korea (7.7 percent), Thailand (5.5 percent) and Hong Kong (5.1 percent).
Japan's main import markets were China (21.3 percent), the US (8.8 percent), Australia (6.4 percent), Saudi Arabia (6.2 percent), United Arab Emirates (5.0 percent), South Korea (4.6 percent) and Qatar (4.0 percent).
, Japan was home to 326 companies from the Forbes Global 2000 or 16.3 percent.
In 2013, it was announced that Japan would be importing shale natural gas.
It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.
===Infrastructure===, 46.1 percent of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 21.3 percent from coal, 21.4 percent from natural gas, 4.0 percent from nuclear power, and 3.3 percent from hydropower.
Given its heavy dependence on imported energy, Japan has aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.
Japan was a venue of the Intercontinental Cup from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea.

Later, quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity.
Weaving was still unknown at the time and clothes were often made of furs.
The Jōmon people started to make clay vessels, decorated with patterns made by impressing the wet clay with braided or unbraided cord and sticks.
The nominees are not publicly named, nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize.
Of the various states, Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla grew to control the peninsula as Three Kingdoms of Korea.
The unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla in 676 led to the North South States Period, in which much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by Unified Silla, while Balhae succeeded to have the control of northern parts of Goguryeo.
Relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful during this time.
During its height, Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of Russian Far East.
After nearly 30 years of war, Goryeo continued to rule Korea, though as a tributary ally to the Mongols.
King Taejo declared the new name of Korea as "Joseon" in reference to Gojoseon, and moved the capital to Hanseong (old name of Seoul).
The first 200 years of the Joseon Dynasty were marked by relative peace and saw the creation of Hangul by King Sejong the Great in the 15th century and the rise in influence of Confucianism in the country.
Between 1592 and 1598, Japan invaded Korea.
In the 1620s and 1630s, Joseon suffered from invasions by the Manchu which eventually extended to China as well.
After another series of wars against Manchuria, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace.
However, the latter years of the Joseon Dynasty were marked by a dependence on China for external affairs and isolation from the outside world.
During the 19th century, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the name the "Hermit Kingdom".
The Joseon Dynasty tried to protect itself against Western imperialism, but was eventually forced to open trade.
At the end of World War II, the Japanese surrendered to Soviet and U.S. forces who occupied the northern and southern halves of Korea, respectively.
===After the division===Despite the initial plan of a unified Korea in the 1943 Cairo Declaration, escalating Cold War antagonism between the Soviet Union and the United States eventually led to the establishment of separate governments, each with its own ideology, leading to Korea's division into two political entities in 1948: North Korea and South Korea.
==Government==Under its current constitution the state is sometimes referred to as the Sixth Republic of South Korea.
Like many democratic states, South Korea has a government divided into three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative.
South Korea is a constitutional democracy.
The South Korean government's structure is determined by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea.
This document has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 at independence.
However, it has retained many broad characteristics and with the exception of the short-lived Second Republic of South Korea, the country has always had a presidential system with an independent chief executive.
The first direct election was also held in 1948.
Although South Korea experienced a series of military dictatorships from the 1960s up until the 1980s, it has since developed into a successful liberal democracy.
The country has also been a member of the United Nations since 1991, when it became a member state at the same time as North Korea.
It has also developed links with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as both a member of "ASEAN Plus three," a body of observers, and the East Asia Summit (EAS).
In 2010, South Korea and the European Union concluded a free trade agreement (FTA) to reduce trade barriers.
South Korea is also negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with Canada, and another with New Zealand.
In November 2009 South Korea joined the OECD Development Assistance Committee, marking the first time a former aid recipient country joined the group as a donor member.
South Korea hosted the G-20 Summit in Seoul in November 2010.
===China===Historically, Korea has had close relations with China.
Before the formation of South Korea, Korean independence fighters worked with Chinese soldiers during the Japanese occupation.
However, after World War II, the People's Republic of China embraced Maoism while South Korea sought close relations with the United States.
The PRC assisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the Korean War, and in its aftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and the PRC almost completely ceased.
There is heavy anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea because of a number of unsettled Japanese-Korean disputes, many of which stem from the period of Japanese occupation after the Japanese annexation of Korea.
During World War II, more than 100,000 Koreans served in the Imperial Japanese Army.
On May 27, 2009, North Korean media declared that the Armistice is no longer valid because of the South Korean government's pledge to "definitely join" the Proliferation Security Initiative.
North Korea initially threatened to sever all ties, to completely abrogate the previous pact of non-aggression, and to expel all South Koreans from a joint industrial zone in Kaesong, but backtracked on its threats and decided to continue its ties with South Korea.
Despite the continuing ties, Kaesong industrial zone has seen a large decrease in investment and manpower as a result of this military conflict.
After three years of military administration by the United States, the South Korean government was established.
Upon the onset of the Korean War, U.S. forces were sent to defend against an invasion from North Korea of the South.
In 1967, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty, by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the Vietnam War.
The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea, and with regard to some of South Korea's industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology.
There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.
In 2007, a free trade agreement known as the Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) was signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation was repeatedly delayed, pending approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries.
It went into effect on March 15, 2012.
The South Korean air force operates 840 aircraft, making it world's ninth largest air force, including several types of advanced fighters like F-15K, heavily modified KF-16C/D, and the indigenous F/A-50, supported by well-maintained fleets of older fighters such as F-4E and KF-5E/F that still effectively serve the air force alongside the more modern aircraft.
In May 2011, Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd., South Korea's largest plane maker, signed a $400 million deal to sell 16 T-50 Golden Eagle trainer jets to Indonesia, making South Korea the first country in Asia to export supersonic jets.
From time to time, South Korea has sent its troops overseas to assist American forces.
It has participated in most major conflicts that the United States has been involved in the past 50 years.
South Korea dispatched 325,517 troops to fight alongside American, Australian, Filipino, New Zealand and South Vietnamese soldiers in the Vietnam War, with a peak strength of 50,000.
In 2004, South Korea sent 3,300 troops of the Zaytun Division to help re-building in northern Iraq, and was the third largest contributor in the coalition forces after only the US and Britain.
Beginning in 2001, South Korea had so far deployed 24,000 troops in the Middle East region to support the War on Terrorism.
A further 1,800 were deployed since 2007 to reinforce UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon.
The United States have stationed a substantial contingent of troops in South Korea since the Korean War to defend South Korea in case of East Asian military crises.
A still functioning UN Command is technically the top of the chain of command of all forces in South Korea, including the US forces and the entire South Korean military – if a sudden escalation of war between North and South Korea were to occur the United States would assume control of the South Korean armed forces in all military and paramilitary moves.
However, in September 2006, the Presidents of the United States and the Republic of Korea agreed that South Korea should assume the lead for its own defense.
In early 2007, the U.S. Secretary of Defense and ROK Minister of National Defense determined that South Korea will assume wartime operational control of its forces on December 1, 2015.
South Korea's economy was one of the world's fastest-growing from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, and South Korea is still one of the fastest-growing developed countries in the 2000s, along with Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, the other three Asian Tigers.
South Koreans refer to this growth as the Miracle on the Han River.
The South Korean economy is heavily dependent on international trade, and in 2013, South Korea was the 8th largest exporter and 7th largest importer in the world.
South Korea hosted the fifth G20 summit in its capital city, Seoul, in November 2010.
The two-day summit was expected to boost South Korea's economy by 31 trillion won, or 4% of South Korea's 2010 GDP, in economic effects, and create over 160,000 jobs in South Korea.
It may also help improve the country's sovereign credit rating.
Despite the South Korean economy's high growth potential and apparent structural stability, the country suffers damage to its credit rating in the stock market because of the belligerence of North Korea in times of deep military crises, which has an adverse effect on South Korean financial markets.
Korail provides frequent train services to all major South Korean cities.
Two rail lines, Gyeongui and Donghae Bukbu Line, to North Korea are now being reconnected.
Express bus terminals are available in most cities.
South Korea's largest airport, Incheon International Airport, was completed in 2001.
There are also seven domestic airports, and a large number of heliports.
South Korea is the world's fifth-largest nuclear power producer and the second-largest in Asia as of 2010.
Nuclear power in South Korea supplies 45% of electricity production, and research is very active with investigation into a variety of advanced reactors, including a small modular reactor, a liquid-metal fast/transmutation reactor and a high-temperature hydrogen generation design.
Fuel production and waste handling technologies have also been developed locally.
It is also a member of the ITER project.
South Korea is an emerging exporter of nuclear reactors, having concluded agreements with the UAE to build and maintain four advanced nuclear reactors, with Jordan for a research nuclear reactor, and with Argentina for construction and repair of heavy-water nuclear reactors.
As of 2010, South Korea and Turkey are in negotiations regarding construction of two nuclear reactors.
South Korea is not allowed to enrich uranium or develop traditional uranium enrichment technology on its own, because of US political pressure, unlike most major nuclear powers such as Japan, Germany, and France, competitors of South Korea in the international nuclear market.
The US has recently been wary of South Korea's burgeoning nuclear program, which South Korea insists will be for civilian use only.
===Aerospace research===South Korea has sent up 10 satellites from 1992, all using foreign rockets and overseas launch pads, notably Arirang-1 in 1999, and Arirang-2 in 2006 as part of its space partnership with Russia.
Arirang-1 was lost in space in 2008, after nine years in service.
In April 2008, Yi So-yeon became the first Korean to fly in space, aboard the Russian Soyuz TMA-12.
In June 2009, the first spaceport of South Korea, Naro Space Center, was completed at Goheung, Jeollanam-do.
The launch of Naro-1 in August 2009 resulted in a failure.
The second attempt in June 2010 was also unsuccessful.
The government plans to develop Naro-2 by the year 2018.
South Korea's efforts to build an indigenous space launch vehicle is marred because of persistent political pressure of the United States, who had for many decades hindered South Korea's indigenous rocket and missile development programs in fear of their possible connection to clandestine military ballistic missile programs, which Korea many times insisted did not violate the research and development guidelines stipulated by US-Korea agreements on restriction of South Korean rocket technology research and development.
South Korea has sought the assistance of foreign countries such as Russia through MTCR commitments to supplement its restricted domestic rocket technology.
The two failed KSLV-I launch vehicles were based on the Universal Rocket Module, the first stage of the Russian Angara rocket, combined with a solid-fueled second stage built by South Korea.
===Robotics===Robotics has been included in the list of main national R&D projects in Korea since 2003.
In 2009, the government announced plans to build robot-themed parks in Incheon and Masan with a mix of public and private funding.
In 2005, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) developed the world's second walking humanoid robot, HUBO.
A team in the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology developed the first Korean android, EveR-1 in May 2006.
===Biotechnology===Since the 1980s, the Korean government has invested in the development of a domestic biotechnology industry, and the sector is projected to grow to by 2010.
The medical sector accounts for a large part of the production, including production of hepatitis vaccines and antibiotics.
==Culture==South Korea shares its traditional culture with North Korea, but the two Koreas have developed distinct contemporary forms of culture since the peninsula was divided in 1945.
Historically, while the culture of Korea has been heavily influenced by that of neighboring China, it has nevertheless managed to develop a unique cultural identity that is distinct from its larger neighbor.
The South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism actively encourages the traditional arts, as well as modern forms, through funding and education programs.
===Art===Korean art has been highly influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, which can be seen in the many traditional paintings, sculptures, ceramics and the performing arts.
The Korean tea ceremony, pansori, talchum and buchaechum are also notable Korean performing arts.
Establishing a harmony between man and nature was also a favorite of this time.
Because of social instability, social issues appeared as main subjects in the 1980s.
Art was influenced by various international events and exhibits in Korea, and with it brought more diversity.
The Olympic Sculpture Garden in 1988, the transposition of the 1993 edition of the Whitney Biennial to Seoul, the creation of the Gwangju Biennale and the Korean Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1995 were notable events.
Korean traditional architecture is characterized by its harmony with nature.
Traditional architecture may also be seen at the nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Korea.
Western architecture was first introduced to Korea at the end of the 19th century.
Churches, offices for foreign legislation, schools and university buildings were built in new styles.
With the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 the colonial regime intervened in Korea's architectural heritage, and Japanese-style modern architecture was imposed.
The anti-Japanese sentiment, and the Korean War, led to the destruction of most buildings constructed during that time.
Korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post-Korean War reconstruction, incorporating modern architectural trends and styles.
Stimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, active redevelopment saw new horizons in architectural design.
In the aftermath of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, South Korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural landscape due, in large part, to the opening up of the market to foreign architects.
Contemporary architectural efforts have been constantly trying to balance the traditional philosophy of "harmony with nature" and the fast-paced urbanization that the country has been going through in recent years.
Ingredients and dishes vary by province.
There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day.
Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.
Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan.
Kimchi (김치), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes.
Soups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal.
The emergence of the rap group Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992 marked a turning point for Korean popular music, also known as K-pop, as the group incorporated elements of popular musical genres of rap, rock, and techno into its music.
Hip hop, dance and ballad oriented acts have become dominant in the Korean popular music scene, though trot is still popular among older Koreans.
Many K-pop stars and groups are also well known abroad, especially in other parts of Asia.
Domestic film has a dominant share of the market, partly because of the existence of screen quotas requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days a year.
===Technology culture===South Korean corporations Samsung and LG were ranked first and third largest mobile phone companies in the world in the first quarter of 2012, respectively.
An estimated 90% of South Koreans own a mobile phone.
Aside from placing/receiving calls and text messaging, mobile phones in the country are widely used for watching Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) or viewing websites.
Over one million DMB phones have been sold and the three major wireless communications providers SK Telecom, KT, and LG U+ provide coverage in all major cities and other areas.
South Korea has the fastest Internet download speeds in the world, with an average download speed of 17.5 Mbit/s.
However, the polling did not indicate the extent to which respondents follow both sports.
The national football team became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the FIFA World Cup semi-finals in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan.
The Korea Republic national team (as it is known) has qualified for every World Cup since Mexico 1986, and has broken out of the group stage twice: first in 2002, and again in 2010, when it was defeated by eventual semi-finalist Uruguay in the Round of 16.
Baseball was first introduced to Korea in 1905 and has since become increasingly popular, with some sources claiming it has surpassed football as the most popular sport in the country.
Recent years have been characterized by increasing attendance and ticket prices for professional baseball games.
The Korea Professional Baseball league, a 9-team circuit, was established in 1982.
The South Korea national team finished third in the 2006 World Baseball Classic and second in the 2009 tournament.
The team's 2009 final game against Japan was widely watched in Korea, with a large screen at Gwanghwamun crossing in Seoul broadcasting the game live.
In the 2008 Summer Olympics, South Korea won the gold medal in baseball.
Also in 1982, at the Baseball Worldcup, Korea won the gold medal.
At the 2010 Asian Games, the Korean National Baseball team won the gold medal.
Basketball is a popular sport in the country as well.
South Korea has traditionally had one of the top basketball teams in Asia and one of the continent's strongest basketball divisions.
Seoul hosted the 1967 and 1995 Asian Basketball Championship.
The Seoul Olympic Museum is a museum in Seoul, South Korea, dedicated to the 1988 Summer Olympics.
South Korea has won more medals in the Winter Olympics than any other Asian country with a total of 45 medals (23 gold, 14 silver, and 8 bronze).
South Korea is especially strong in short track speed skating.
However, speed skating and figure skating are very popular, too, and ice hockey is an emerging sport with Anyang Halla winning their first ever Asia League Ice Hockey title in March 2010.
Seoul hosted a professional triathlon race, which is part of the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Championship Series in May 2010.
David Ben-Gurion (; , born David Grün; 16 October 1886 – 1 December 1973) was the primary founder and the first Prime Minister of Israel.
He was arrested twice during the Russian Revolution of 1905.
==History=====Prehistory===The oldest traces of human life in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago.
As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region.
The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household).
One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Islamic invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms.
In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald.
West Francia approximated the area occupied by, and was the precursor, to modern France.
Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king.
For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added "King of England" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions.
His descendants the Capetians, the House of Valois, and the House of Bourbon progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the Kingdom of France, which was fully declared in 1190 by Philip II Augustus.
In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the kingdom of France.
Later Kings expanded their domain to cover over half of modern continental France, including most of the North, Centre and West of France.
Charles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.
Under the rules of the Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line.
Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, a cousin of Charles, rather than through the female line to Charles' nephew, Edward, who would soon become Edward III of England.
During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.
Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England and in 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the Hundred Years' War.
The exact boundaries changed greatly with time, but French landholdings of the English Kings remained extensive for decades.
Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death; half of the 17 million population of France died.
The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.
The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots.
Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power.
French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.
France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia.
Under Louis XV, Louis XIV's grandson, France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War, which ended in 1763.
Louis XVI, Louis XV's grandson, actively supported the Americans, who were seeking their independence from Great Britain (realized in the Treaty of Paris (1783)).
The example of the American Revolution and the financial crisis that followed France's involvement in it were two of many contributing factors to the French Revolution.
Much of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the discovery of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists.
French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe.
European monarchies gathered against the new régime, to restore the French absolute monarchy.
As a result of this violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy, the Republic was proclaimed on 22 September 1792.
As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire.
His armies conquered most of continental Europe, while members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.
After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, the monarchy was re-established (1815–1830), with new constitutional limitations.
The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy, which lasted until 1848, when the French Second Republic was proclaimed, in the wake of the European Revolutions of 1848.
He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, in Mexico and Italy.
Including metropolitan France, the total area of land under French sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land.
A small part of Northern France was occupied, but France and its allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at a tremendous human and material cost.
The interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government (annual leave, eight-hour workdays, women in government, etc...).
France was one of the founding members of NATO (1949).
Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria.
In 1958, the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened Presidency.
In the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968, the revolt of May 1968 had an enormous social impact.
In France, it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution).
As of 2014 there are 49 PNRs in France.
The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government, and thus the majority in the Assembly determines the choice of government.
Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms (originally 9-year terms), and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years starting in September 2008.
Since the 2012 elections, the executive branch is currently composed mostly of the Socialist Party.
===Law===France uses a civil legal system; that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law).
Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV).
As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation, wrote about the management of prisons: "Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.
France has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws (the latter being abolished in 1791).
Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881.
Some consider however that hate speech laws in France are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech.
France has laws against racism and antisemitism.
However, since the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, the State tries to prevent its policy-making from being influenced by religion and became suspicious in recent decades towards new religious tendencies of the French society: the Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995, and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004.
In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public.
As some have complained that they have suffered from discrimination thus, and after criticism by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, these laws remain controversial, although they are supported by most of the population.
In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process, seeking to build its own standing in continental Europe.
However, since 1904, France has maintained an "Entente cordiale" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily.
France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), but under President de Gaulle, it excluded itself from the joint military command to protest the special relationship between the United States and Britain and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies.
France vigorously opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, straining bilateral relations with the US and the UK.
In the early 1990s, the country drew considerable criticism from other nations for its underground nuclear tests in French Polynesia.
France retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies (Françafrique) and has supplied economic aid and troops for peace-keeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad.
In 2009, France was the second largest (in absolute numbers) donor of development aid in the world, behind the US, and ahead of Germany, Japan and the UK.
This represents 0.5% of its GDP, in this regard rating France as tenth largest donor on the list.
The gendarmerie is a military police force that serves for the most part as a rural and general purpose police force.
There has been no national conscription since 1997.
France is a permanent member of the Security Council of the UN, and a recognised nuclear state since 1960.
France's annual military expenditure in 2011 was US$62.5 billion, or 2.3%, of its GDP making it the fifth biggest military spender in the world after the United States, China, Russia, and the United Kingdom.
The current French nuclear force consists of four "Triomphant" class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
France has major military industries with one of the largest aerospace industries in the world.
Despite withdrawing from the Eurofighter project, France is actively investing in European joint projects such as the Eurocopter Tiger, multipurpose frigates, the UCAV demonstrator nEUROn and the Airbus A400M.
The military parade held in Paris each 14 July for France's national day is the oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe.
The new government stated that it aimed to cancel recently enacted tax cuts and exemptions for the wealthy, raising the top tax bracket rate to 75% on incomes over a million euros, restoring the retirement age to 60 with a full pension for those who have worked 42 years, restoring 60,000 jobs recently cut from public education, regulating rent increases; and building additional public housing for the poor.
French government bond interest rates fell 30% to record lows, less than 50 basis points above German government bond rates.
====Government debt====Under European Union rules, member states are supposed to limit their debt to 60% of output or be reducing the ratio structurally towards this ceiling, and run public deficits of no more than 3% of GDP.
The French government has run a budget deficit each year since the early 1970s.
In 2012, French government debt levels reached 1.8 trillion euros, the equivalent of 90% of French GDP.
===Tourism===With 83 million foreign tourists in 2012, France is ranked as the first tourist destination in the world, ahead of the US (67 million) and China (58 million).
This 83 million figure excludes people staying less than 24 hours, such as North Europeans crossing France on their way to Spain or Italy.
It is third in income from tourism due to shorter duration of visits.
The "Remarkable Gardens" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the French Ministry of Culture.
France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées that hosts several million visitors a year.
France, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest and renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world, the Musée d'Orsay, mostly devoted to impressionism, and Beaubourg, dedicated to Contemporary art.
Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009.
With more than 10 millions tourists a year, the French Riviera (or "Côte d'Azur"), in south-east France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris region.
It benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.
The most popular tourist sites include: (according to a 2003 ranking visitors per year): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Louvre Museum (5.7 million), Palace of Versailles (2.8 million), Musée d'Orsay (2.1 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Centre Pompidou (1.2 million), Mont Saint-Michel (1 million), Château de Chambord (711,000), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg (549,000), Puy de Dôme (500,000), Musée Picasso (441,000), Carcassonne (362,000).
==Culture==France has been a center of Western cultural development for centuries.
Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time, and France is still recognized in the world for its rich cultural tradition.
The successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation, and the creation of the Ministry of Culture in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public.
The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting historical monuments.
It counts 1,200 museums welcoming more than 50 million people annually.
The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency Centre des monuments nationaux, which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments.
The UNESCO inscribed 38 sites in France on the World Heritage List.
The Stade de France in Saint-Denis is France's largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals.
France hosts the annual Tour de France, the most famous road bicycle race in the world.
After Athens was awarded the first Games, in reference to the Olympics' Greek origins, Paris hosted the second Games in 1900.
The football team is among the most successful in the world, particularly at the start of the 21st century, with one FIFA World Cup victory in 1998, one FIFA World Cup second place in 2006, and two UEFA European Championships in 1984 and 2000.
This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must already be thinking about it.
Oliver Leaman, an expert on Islamic philosophy, points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself, but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at.

Gaza fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine.
Gaza was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, but in 1993, the city was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority.
However, it was abandoned by the 14th century BCE, at the end of the Bronze Age.
Gaza remained under Egyptian control for 350 years until it was conquered by the Philistines in the 12th century BC, becoming a part of their "pentapolis".
Alexander the Great besieged Gaza, the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt, for five months before finally capturing it 332 BCE; the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive.
It was targeted by Jewish forces during their rebellion against Roman rule in 66 and was partially destroyed.
Christianity began to spread throughout Gaza in 250 CE, including in the port of Maiuma.
Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420.

Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain wine production and grapes, a major cash crop in the city, were exported mainly to Egypt.
Because it bordered the desert, Gaza was vulnerable to warring nomadic groups.
In 796 Gaza was destroyed during a civil war between the Arab tribes of the area.

Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as a "city so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land.
They also allowed Jews to return to the city, and the Mamluk period saw a flourishing Jewish community in the city.

In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad.
The total number of Christian families was 57.
About 28.8% were between the ages of 20 to 44, 7.7% between 45 and 64, and 3.9% were over the age of 64.
In 1906 there were about 750 Christians, of which 700 were Orthodox and 50 were Roman Catholic.
Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual distrust between them and the Arab majority.

In 2006, there were 210 schools in Gaza; 151 were run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and 13 were private schools.
A total of 154,251 students were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed.

A chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances.
Similarly, theories from classical physics can be used to predict many ionic structures.
Chemical reactions can result in the formation or dissociation of molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules, or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules.

He won the Nobel Prize in Literature, and was the first person to be made an honorary citizen of the United States.
In March 1909, the couple moved to a house at 33 Eccleston Square.
Their first child, Diana, was born in London on 11 July 1909.
Their third child, Sarah, was born on 7 October 1914 at Admiralty House.
Clementine gave birth to her fourth child, Marigold Frances Churchill, on 15 November 1918, four days after the official end of the First World War.
On 15 September 1922, the Churchills' last child, Mary, was born.
Churchill had fond memories of Cuba as a "... large, rich, beautiful island ...".
In 1897, Churchill attempted to travel to both report on and, if necessary, fight in the Greco-Turkish War, but this conflict effectively ended before he could arrive.
While in the Sudan, he participated in what has been described as the last meaningful British cavalry charge, at the Battle of Omdurman in September 1898.
"Churchill resigned from the British Army effective from 5 May 1899.
He was among the first British troops into Ladysmith and Pretoria.
In 1900, Churchill returned to England on the , the same ship on which he had set sail for South Africa eight months earlier.
He won the seat at the 1906 general election with a majority of 1,214 and represented the seat for two years.
In 1908, he introduced the Trade Boards Bill setting up the first minimum wages in Britain.
He helped draft the first unemployment pension legislation, the National Insurance Act of 1911.
He became Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1921 and was a signatory of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which established the Irish Free State.
Churchill did not seek election to the Conservative Business Committee, the official leadership of the Conservative MPs.
When Ramsay MacDonald formed the National Government in 1931, Churchill was not invited to join the Cabinet.
In this the Government was supported by the Liberal Party and, officially at least, by the Conservative Party.
Some historians see his basic attitude to India as being set out in his book "My Early Life" (1930).
He wrote in part:This movement among Jews is not new ... but a "world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality.
On 12 November, Churchill returned to the topic.
The Abdication crisis became public, coming to a head in the first two weeks of December 1936.

An American journalist wrote in 1941: "The responsibilities which are his now must be greater than those carried by any other human being on earth.
" Another associate wrote: "He is ... the slave of the words which his mind forms about ideas ... And he can convince himself of almost every truth if it is once allowed thus to start on its wild career through his rhetorical machinery.
It was for this reason that Churchill was relieved when Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940.
Upon re-election, Roosevelt immediately set about implementing a new method of providing military hardware and shipping to Britain without the need for monetary payment.
On the same day in a BBC news flash John Snagge announced that 8 May would be Victory in Europe Day.
Many reasons for his defeat have been given, key among them being that a desire for post-war reform was widespread amongst the population and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead the nation in peace.
In Malaya, a rebellion against British rule had been in progress since 1948.
After leaving the premiership, Churchill spent less time in parliament until he stood down at the 1964 general election.
He died at his London home nine days later, at age 90, on the morning of Sunday 24 January 1965, 70 years to the day after his father's death.
In Europe 350 million people, including 25 million in Britain, watched the funeral on television, and only Ireland did not broadcast it live.
In the fields along the route, and at the stations through which the train passed, thousands stood in silence to pay their last respects.
Churchill is best known for his impressionist scenes of landscape, many of which were painted while on holiday in the South of France, Egypt or Morocco.
The villa was rebuilt within the museum in 1985 with a gallery of Churchill paintings and memorabilia.

In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's favor, and Arafat returned to Cairo from a lack of logistical support.
Arafat continued this process in other Arab countries such as Libya and Syria.
After the passengers were moved to other locations, three of the planes were blown up.
On the same day, Arafat became supreme commander of the PLA.

In response to the closure of schools, residents organized home schooling sessions to help students make up missed material; this became one of the few symbols of civil disobedience.
In 1991, the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid International Peace Conference included many notables from Ramallah.
In the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 100,034, including 23,397 refugees, accounting for about 24% of the city's residents.
Nablus' Old City had a population of 12,000 in 2006.
In 1997, the age distribution of the city's inhabitants was 28.4% under the age of 10, 20.8% from 10 to 19, 17.7% from 20–29, 18% from 30 to 44, 11.1% from 45 to 64 and 3.7% above the age of 65.
In 1967, there were about 3,500 Christians of various denominations in Nablus, but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008.
Most Christians used to live in the suburb of Rafidia in the western part of the city.
In addition to that, in 2001, Nablus Speciality Hospital was built, in which it is specialized in open heart surgery, angiograms and angioplasties.
==Municipal services==In 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network.
The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far'a, al-Badan and Audala.

===Corruption===A poll conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research revealed that 71% of Palestinians believe there is corruption in the Palestinian Authority institutions in the West Bank, and 57% say there is corruption in the institutions of the dismissed Palestinian government in the Gaza Strip.
34% say that there is no freedom of the press in the West Bank, 21% say that there is press freedom in the West Bank, and 41% say there is to a certain extent.
29% of Palestinians say people in the West Bank can criticize the government in the West Bank without fear.
The Palestinian Investment Fund, for example, was intended to serve the interests of the Palestinian population and was supposed to be transparent, accountable, and independent of the Palestinian political leadership.

After a power struggle with the board of directors in 1985, Jobs left Apple and founded NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in the higher-education and business markets.
Jobs was also a fan of The Beatles.
According to reports, he kept a 1966 BMW R60/2 motorcycle in the living room of the Jackling House, and let Bill Clinton use it in 1998.
Clinton returned the favor and Jobs, who was a Democratic donor, slept in the Lincoln bedroom of the White House.
During Jobs's absence, Tim Cook, head of worldwide sales and operations at Apple, ran the company.
Ohio's neighbors are Pennsylvania to the east, Michigan to the northwest, Ontario Canada, to the north, Indiana to the west, Kentucky on the south, and West Virginia on the southeast.
After the devastation of epidemics and war in the mid-17th century, which largely emptied the Ohio country of indigenous people by the mid-to-late 17th century, the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly Algonquian-speaking descendants of its ancient inhabitants, that is, descendants of the Adena, Hopewell, and Mississippian cultures.
By the 18th century, they were part of a larger global economy brought about by European entry into the fur trade.
The indigenous nations to inhabit Ohio in the historical period included the Miamis (a large confederation); Wyandots (made up of refugees, especially from the fractured Huron confederacy); Delawares (pushed west from their historic homeland in New Jersey); Shawnees (also pushed west, although they may have been descended from the Fort Ancient people of Ohio); Ottawas (more commonly associated with the upper Great Lakes region); Mingos (like the Wyandot, a group recently formed of refugees from Iroquois); and Eries (gradually absorbed into the new, multi-ethnic "republics," namely the Wyandot).
Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes region of the Midwestern United States.
The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world, being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes, plus Lake Saint Clair.
The Roman Catholic Church was the only organized religion in Michigan until the 19th century, reflecting the territory's French colonial roots.
It is now the measurement unit used officially for expressing distances between geographical places on land in most of the world; notable exceptions are the United States and the United Kingdom where the statute mile is the official unit used.

The diameter of the Sun is about 109 times that of Earth, and it has a mass about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
The solar constant is equal to approximately (watts per square meter) at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (that is, on or near Earth).
Only 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from the CNO cycle.
Because this reaction uses four free protons (hydrogen nuclei), it converts about 3.7 protons to alpha particles (helium nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9 free protons in the Sun), or about 6.2 kg/s.
At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000th the density of air at sea level).
In the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized.
The low corona, near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density around 1015–1016 m−3.
Turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfvén waves.
The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field.
These could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the Milankovitch cycles.
===Formation===The Sun was formed about 4.57 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars.
This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed.
The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star.
However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today.
The consensus among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young Earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane and/or ammonia) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.
===Early understanding===Like other natural phenomena, the Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human history.
In 1666, Isaac Newton observed the Sun's light using a prism, and showed that it was made up of light of many colors.
In the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle.
In 1890 Joseph Lockyer, who discovered helium in the solar spectrum, proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.
One of the most important solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995.
Hungary ( , formally, until 2012, the Republic of Hungary ( ) is a landlocked country in Central Europe.
The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight.
Primary properties of visible light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarisation, while its speed in a vacuum, 299,792,458 meters per second, is one of the fundamental constants of nature.
The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.
==Light sources==There are many sources of light.
A simple thermal source is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the chromosphere of the Sun at around 6,000 Kelvin peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.
Another example is incandescent light bulbs, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared.
A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in flames, but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared, and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.
The peak of the blackbody spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 micrometer wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings.
As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one, and finally a blue-white colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet.
Blue-white thermal emission is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue colour in a gas flame or a welder's torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425 nm, and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).
The climate varies from tropical in the lowlands to temperate in the mountains.
The central and southern regions are relatively hotter and less humid than the northern coast.
Like other countries in the region, Honduras contains vast biological resources.
The country hosts more than 6,000 species of vascular plants, of which 630 (described so far) are orchids; around 250 reptiles and amphibians, more than 700 bird species, and 110 mammal species, half of them being bats.
It is estimated that there are more than 1.2 million people who are unemployed, the rate of unemployment standing at 27.9%.
After years of decline against the U.S. dollar, lempira recently stabilized at around 19 lempiras per dollar.
On 7 December 2006, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy announced the first phase of the Secure Freight Initiative, an unprecedented effort to build upon existing port security measures by enhancing the U.S. government’s authority to scan containers from overseas for nuclear and radiological materials to better assess the risk of inbound containers.
The initial phase of Secure Freight involves the deployment of nuclear detection and other devices to six foreign ports: Port Qasim in Pakistan; Puerto Cortes in Honduras; Southampton in the United Kingdom; Port Salalah in Oman; Port of Singapore; and the Gamman Terminal at Port Busan in Korea.
Since early 2007, containers from these ports have been scanned for radiation and other risk factors before they are allowed to depart for the United States.
It contains five blue stars representing the five states of the Central American Union.
The middle star represents Honduras, located in the center of the Central American Union.
It is an equilateral triangle, at the base is a volcano between three castles, over which is a rainbow and the sun shining.
It is one of two species of deer that live in Honduras.
The exact moment is dependent on the geographical longitude, and to a lesser extent on the time of the year.
This rule gives an average year length of 365.25 days.
Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei.
These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness, and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye.
These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the asteroid belt), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were reclassified as "asteroids".
=== 20th century ===In the 20th century, Pluto was discovered.
The discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a planet: the point at which a planet becomes a star.
In the Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic.
The eight planets of the Solar System all lie very close to the ecliptic; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it.
The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet.
Its mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury.
In 2004, a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star HD 179949, which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star.
=== Secondary characteristics ===Several planets or dwarf planets in the Solar System (such as Neptune and Pluto) have orbital periods that are in resonance with each other or with smaller bodies (this is also common in satellite systems).
The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases.
Although the symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected, the bulk of CD4+ T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection, especially in the intestinal mucosa, which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body.
October ( ) is the tenth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars and one of seven months with a length of 31 days.

The average diameter of the reference spheroid is about , which is approximately 40,000 km/π, because the meter was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole through Paris, France.
The geochemist F. W. Clarke calculated that a little more than 47% of Earth's crust consists of oxygen.
The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific, and has an estimated age of about .
The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both.
Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.
It has a composition of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with trace amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules.
Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.
Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian.
The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.8 km/s (107,000 km/h), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km, in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km, in about 3.5 hours.
Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise.
Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun.
Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way galaxy and orbits about 28,000 light years from the center of the galaxy.
In the southern hemisphere the situation is exactly reversed, with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole.
By astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the solstices—the point in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular.
In the northern hemisphere, winter solstice occurs on about December 21, summer solstice is near June 21, spring equinox is around March 20 and autumnal equinox is about September 23.
The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time.
The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800 year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year.
Because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year.
This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.
Some of these are non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, that are difficult to replenish on a short time scale.
Most of the growth is expected to take place in developing nations.
By 2020, 60% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas.
The first human to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961.
To the west, the same tribes might have built hunting camps to hunt winter game.
Copper finds show that there was trade with other areas in Europe, as natural copper is not found in Dutch soil.
In the second millennium BC, the region was the boundary between the Atlantic and Nordic horizons, roughly divided by the course of the Rhine.
Iron ore was available throughout the country, including bog iron extracted from the ore in peat bogs in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the Veluwe and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant.
The King's grave of Oss dating from around 500 BC was found in a burial mound, the largest of its kind in western Europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral.
The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the Frisii, remained outside Roman rule (but not its presence and control), while the border tribes Batavi and Cananefates served in the Roman cavalry.
The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the Salian Franks, whose identity emerged at the first half of the third century.
During this expansion, Franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the Vulgar Latin of the local population.
Most of what is today the Netherlands became part of Middle Francia; Flanders became part of West Francia.
The latter part comprising of the Low Countries, that technically became part of East Francia in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless Frisian and Frankish towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers.
The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally Frisian.
Wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign.
In practice, this meant that Brugge and Antwerp became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.
Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county.
The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, that developed rapidly.
The fleets of the County of Holland defeated the fleets of the Hanseatic League several times.
Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England.
This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself.
The Dutch settlement in North America began with the founding of New Amsterdam on the southern part of Manhattan in 1614.
Two years later, the Congress of Vienna added the southern Netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of France.
Government-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500,000 Dutch people to leave the country after the war.
On 14 December 1287, St. Lucia's flood affected the Netherlands and Germany killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.
The huge North Sea flood of early February 1953 caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood.
Because of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.
To guard against floods, a series of defences against the water were contrived.
By the 13th century windmills had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level.
=====Delta works=====After the 1953 disaster, the Delta Works were constructed, a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast.
The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the Maeslantkering.
A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country).
The Delta project is considered by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world.
It is anticipated that global warming in the 21st century will result in a rise in sea level which, despite popular belief, will possibly not overwhelm the measures the Netherlands has taken to control floods.
Even more specifically, the Netherlands is the only country in the world actively preparing for a sea level rise.
Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the sea side, but could also alter rain fall patterns and river run-off.
According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the territory of the Netherlands belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests.
The highest point is Mount Scenery, , on Saba (also the highest point in all the Kingdom of the Netherlands).
Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole.
The executive power is formed by the council of Ministers, the deliberative council of the Dutch cabinet.
The head of government is the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition.
Mark Rutte has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973.
In the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of pillarisation, in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government.
Since suffrage became universal in 1919, the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the Christian democrats, currently represented by the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA); second were the social democrats, represented by the Labour Party (PvdA); and third were the liberals, of which the right wing People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is the main representative.
In the 1970s, the party system became more volatile: the Christian democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the radical democrat and progressive liberal D66.
In the 2002 elections, this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right LPF, a new political party, around Pim Fortuyn, who was assassinated a week before the elections.
In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the Socialist Party made the largest gains.
On 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in Uruzgan, Afghanistan.
The creation of water boards actually pre-dates that of the nation itself, the first appearing in 1196.
The Dutch water boards are among the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence.
The foreign policy of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to Atlantic co-operation, to European integration, to international development and to international law.
One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its liberal policy towards soft drugs.
The Dutch army was used throughout the Dutch Empire.
After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the Netherlands was invaded in the Second World War and quickly defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.
Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the Bosnian War and the Kosovo War, it held a province in Iraq after the defeat of Saddam Hussein, and it was engaged in Afghanistan.
The Korps Commandotroepen, the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army, is open to women, but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training, it is almost impossible for women to become a commando.
In April 2011 the government announced a major reduction in its military because of a cut in government expenditure, including a decrease in the number of tanks, fighter aircraft, naval ships and senior officials.
Since the 16th century, shipping, fishing, agriculture, trade, and banking have been leading sectors of the Dutch economy.
The Netherlands is one of the world's 10 leading exporting countries.
Foodstuffs form the largest industrial sector.
Other major industries include chemicals, metallurgy, machinery, electrical goods, and tourism (in 2012 the Netherlands welcomed 11.7 million international tourists).
Examples includeUnilever, Heineken, financial services (ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank), chemicals (DSM, AKZO), petroleum refining (Shell), electronical machinery (Philips, ASML), and car navigation (TomTom).
Growth slowed considerably from 2001 to 2005 with the global economic slowdown, but accelerated to 4.1% in the third quarter of 2007.
In May 2013, inflation was at 2.8% per year.
In April 2013, unemployment was at 8.2% (or 6.7% following the ILO definition) of the labour force.
The Netherlands also has a relatively low GINI coefficient of 0.326.
On the Index of Economic Freedom Netherlands is the 13th most free market capitalist economy out of 157 surveyed countries.
One euro was equivalent to 2.20371 Dutch guilders.
Other important parts of the economy are international trade (Dutch colonialism started with co-operative private enterprises such as the VOC), banking and transport.
Amsterdam is the 5th-busiest tourist destination in Europe with more than 4.2 million international visitors.
Since the enlargement of the EU large numbers of migrant workers have arrived in the Netherlands from central and eastern Europe.
The Netherlands continues to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the United States.
The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005, but in 2006 recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports and strong investment.
The pace of job growth reached 10-year highs in 2007.
Rotterdam has the largest port in Europe, with the rivers Meuse and Rhine providing excellent access to the hinterland upstream reaching to Basel, Switzerland, and into France.
The fertility rate in the Netherlands is 1.78 children per woman (2013 est), which is high compared with many other European countries, but below the rate of 2.1 children per woman required for natural population replacement.
Life expectancy is high in the Netherlands: 83.21 years for newborn girls and 78.93 for boys (2013 est).
The country has a migration rate of 1.99 migrants per 1,000 inhabitants per year.
People in the south are on average about shorter than those in the north.
Dutch people, or descendants of Dutch people, are also found in migrant communities worldwide, notably in Canada, Australia, Brazil, South Africa and the United States.
The Randstad is the country's largest conurbation located in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities: Amsterdam in the province North Holland, Rotterdam and The Hague in the province South Holland, and Utrecht in the province Utrecht.
The Randstad has a population of 7 million inhabitants and is the 6th largest metropolitan area in Europe.
Sikhs are another religious minority in the Netherlands, numbering around 12,000, mainly located in or around Amsterdam.
There are five gurudwaras in the Netherlands.
Around 10% of the population of Amsterdam was Jewish at the start of World War II.
The Dutch East Indies, which later formed modern-day Indonesia, was one of the most valuable European colonies in the world and the most important one for the Netherlands.
Over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the Netherlands.
When the Dutch Royal Family was established in 1815, much of its wealth came from Colonial trade.
Universities such as the Royal Leiden University, founded in the 16th century, have developed into leading knowledge centres for South-east Asian and Indonesian studies.
This relatively large Eurasian population had developed over a period of 400 years and were classified by colonial law as belonging to the European legal community.
Including their second generation descendants, Indos are currently the largest foreign-born group in the Netherlands.

Richard Matthew Stallman (born March 16, 1953), often known by his initials, rms, is a software freedom activist and computer programmer.
He has been the GNU project's lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software including, among others, the GNU Compiler Collection, the GNU Debugger and the GNU Emacs text editor.
In 1989 he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom.
His first experience with actual computers was at the IBM New York Scientific Center when he was in high school.
This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems.
, the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking.
The technique of constraint recording, wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper.
To prevent software from being used on their competitors' computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing source code and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution.
Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users.
Richard Greenblatt, a fellow AI Lab hacker, founded Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI) to market Lisp machines, which he and Tom Knight designed at the lab.
In February 1984, Stallman quit his job at MIT to work full-time on the GNU project, which he had announced in September 1983.
" Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement.
Stallman's staunch advocacy for free software inspired the creation of the Virtual Richard M. Stallman (vrms), software that analyzes the packages currently installed on a Debian GNU/Linux system, and reports those that are from the non-free tree.
In August 2006, at his meetings with the government of the Indian State of Kerala, he persuaded officials to discard proprietary software, such as Microsoft's, at state-run schools.
ATI has since merged with AMD Corporation and has taken steps to make their hardware documentation available for use by the free software community.
Stallman has also helped and supported the International Music Score Library Project in getting back on-line, after it had been taken down on October 19, 2007 following a cease and desist letter from Universal Edition.
Nasser introduced a new constitution in 1964, the same year he became president of the international Non-Aligned Movement, which he co-founded.
After the conclusion of the 1970 Arab League summit, Nasser suffered a heart attack and died.
Historians describe Nasser as one of the towering political figures of the Middle East in the 20th century.
On 12 December, the new king, Farouk, issued a decree restoring the constitution.
Nasser spent most of his spare time reading, particularly in 1933 when he lived near the National Library of Egypt.
Nasser returned to Sudan in September 1942 after a brief stay in Egypt, then secured a position as an instructor in the Cairo Royal Military Academy in May 1943.
On 12 July, he was lightly wounded in the fighting.
Negotiations between Israel and Egypt finally resulted in the ceding of Faluja to Israel.
Nasser was sent as a member of the Egyptian delegation to Rhodes in February 1949 to negotiate a formal armistice with Israel, and reportedly considered the terms to be humiliating, particularly because the Israelis were able to easily occupy the Eilat region while negotiating with the Arabs in March.
===Revolution of 1952===On 25 January 1952, a confrontation between British forces and police at Ismailia resulted in the deaths of 40 Egyptian policemen, provoking riots in Cairo the next day which left 76 people dead.
The Free Officers seized control of all government buildings, radio stations, and police stations, as well as army headquarters in Cairo.
In September, the Agrarian Reform Law was put into effect.
The Israelis re-militarized the al-Auja Demilitarized Zone on the Egyptian border on 21 September.
Simultaneous with Israel's February raid, the Baghdad Pact was formed between some regional allies of the UK.
When it became apparent to him that Western countries would not supply Egypt under acceptable financial and military terms, Nasser turned to the Eastern Bloc and concluded a armaments agreement with Czechoslovakia on 27 September.
===Adoption of neutralism===At the Bandung Conference in Indonesia in late April, Nasser was treated as the leading representative of the Arab countries and was one of the most popular figures at the summit.
Nasser was welcomed by large crowds of people lining the streets of Cairo on his return to Egypt on 2 May and was widely heralded in the press for his achievements and leadership in the conference.
He believed, however, that the UK would not be able to intervene militarily for at least two months after the announcement, and dismissed Israeli action as "impossible".
Two days later, British and French planes bombarded Egyptian airfields in the canal zone.
By the end of December, British and French forces had totally withdrawn from Egyptian territory, while Israel completed its withdrawal in March 1957 and released all Egyptian prisoners of war.
This effort achieved a measure of success, with increased agricultural production and investment in industrialization.
Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of the Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds.
On 24 February, Nasser traveled to Damascus in a surprise visit to celebrate the union.
He was welcomed by crowds in the hundreds of thousands.
On 15 July, US marines landed in Lebanon, and British special forces in Jordan, upon the request of those countries' governments to prevent them from falling to pro-Nasser forces.
By moving the latter two, who were Ba'athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how Syria should be run.
In Egypt, the economic situation was more positive, with a GNP growth of 4.5 percent and a rapid growth of industry.
A similar alliance toppled the Syrian government on 8 March.
In January 1964, Nasser called for an Arab League summit in Cairo to establish a unified Arab response against Israel's plans to divert the Jordan River's waters for economic purposes, which Syria and Jordan deemed an act of war.
In 1964, Nasser was made president of the NAM and held the second conference of the organization in Cairo.
In early 1962 Nasser again attempted to wrest control of the military command from Amer.
New laws provided workers with a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management.
With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers.
Earlier that day, Nasser received a warning from King Hussein of Israeli-American collusion to drag Egypt into war.
Although in the preceding months, Hussein and Nasser had been accusing each other of avoiding a fight with Israel, Hussein was nonetheless wary that an Egyptian-Israeli war would risk the West Bank's occupation by Israel.
Amer committed suicide on 14 September.
He also advised Arafat to think of peace with Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state comprising the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
The war resumed in March 1969.
Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US.
The state of Nasser's health was not known to the public prior to his death.
Following the announcement of Nasser's death, Egypt and the Arab world were in a state of shock.
All Arab heads of state attended, with the exception of Saudi King Faisal.
The general Arab reaction was one of mourning, with thousands of people pouring onto the streets of major cities throughout the Arab world.
Over a dozen people were killed in Beirut as a result of the chaos, and in Jerusalem, roughly 75,000 Arabs marched through the Old City chanting, "Nasser will never die.
During his presidency, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment, as well as other forms of social welfare, while feudalistic influence waned.
However, the marked economic growth of the early 1960s took a downturn for the remainder of the decade, only recovering in 1970.
Sabahi came in third place during the 2012 presidential election.
He is also considered a champion of social justice in Egypt.
Also in 1969, Colonel Gaafar Nimeiry, a supporter of Nasser, took power in Sudan.
He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode.
State media reported that Nasser's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza.

Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history.
In October 1836 he arrived in Berlin, matriculating in the university's faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse.
Marx's father died in May 1838, resulting in a diminished income for the family.
Marx had been emotionally close to his father, and treasured his memory after his death.
Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843 Marx married Jenny in a Protestant church in Kreuznach.
Based in Paris, France, it was here that Marx and his wife moved in October 1843.
After the paper's collapse, Marx began writing for the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper left, "Vorwärts!
In "Vorwärts!
", Marx refined his views on socialism based upon Hegelian and Feuerbachian ideas of dialectical materialism, at the same time criticising liberals and other socialists operating in Europe.
On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence, beginning a lifelong friendship.
Engels showed Marx his recently published "The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844", convincing Marx that the working class would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history.
However, Marx needed to write down all of the details of his economic world view to further clarify the new economic theory in his own mind.
Accordingly, Marx wrote "The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts".
Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions, and often violent upheavals that became known as the Revolution of 1848.
In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic.
Marx was supportive of such activity, and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father of either 6000 or 5000 francs, allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action.
Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counter-revolution and a cholera epidemic, and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered him a political threat.
With his wife, Jenny, expecting their fourth child, and not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.
The headquarters of the Communist League also moved to London.
Such an uprising, as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe.
Changes in society, Marx argued, are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of "a handful of men.
" Instead, they are brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development.
In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution.
London became the new headquarters of the Communist League.
The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district.
The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League.
Marx, however, lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and, on 17 September 1850, resigned from the Society.
Marx's main contact on the "Tribune" was Charles Dana.
Later, in 1868, Charles Dana would leave the "Tribune" to become the owner and editor-in-chief of the "New York Sun", a competing newspaper in New York City.
However, at this time Charles Dana served on the editorial board of the "Tribune".
Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses of the working class of the United States.
With a run of about 50,000 issues, the "Tribune" was the most widely circulated journal in the United States.
Not only did the "Tribune" have wide readership with the United States and not only did that readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed to be from the progressive wing of the working class.
Marx's first article for the "New York Tribune" was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the "Tribune" on 21 August 1852.
Marx was just one of the reporters in Europe that the "New York Tribune" employed.
However, with the slavery crisis coming to a head in the late 1850s and with the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the American public's interest in European affairs declined.
"From December 1851 to March 1852, Marx wrote "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon", a work on the French Revolution of 1848, in which he expanded upon his concepts of historical materialism, class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, advancing the argument that victorious proletariat has to smash the bourgeois state.
The 1850s and 1860s also mark the line between what some scholars see as idealistic, Hegelian young Marx from the more scientifically minded mature Marx writings of the later period.
This distinction is usually associated with the structural Marxism school, and not all scholars agree that it exists.
The years of revolution from 1848 to 1849 had been a grand experience for both Marx and Engels.
They both became sure that their economic view of the course of history was the only valid way that historic events like the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 could be adequately explained.
As time passed, they began to think that a new revolutionary upsurge would not occur until there was another economic downturn.
However, the United States' economy was too new to play host to a classical revolution.
Any economic crisis which began in the United States would not lead to revolution unless one of the older economies of Europe "caught the contagion" from the United States.
In other words, economies of the world were still seen as individual national systems which were contiguous with the national borders of each country.
The Panic of 1857 broke the mould of all prior thinking on the world economy.
Although Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Marx supported, led to the decline of the International.
In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, "The Civil War in France", a defence of the Commune.
"In a letter to Vera Zasulich dated 8 March 1881, Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village "mir".
" In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past.
He wrote that "the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type—collective production and appropriation".
Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State".
While in Paris, he used that of "Monsieur Ramboz", whilst in London he signed off his letters as "A. Williams".
Two telegrams from workers' parties in France and Spain were also read out.
In 1970 there was an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the monument using a homemade bomb.
The other important contribution to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, "The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844", which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.
Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths; they serve an important political function.
Accumulation of capital shapes the social system.
Social change, for Marx, was about conflict between opposing interests, driven, in the background, by economic forces.
In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism.
Marx noted that this was not an intentional process; rather, no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.
Marx's view of capitalism was two-sided.
In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the scientific method.
Both Marx and Auguste Comte set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European secularisation and new developments in the philosophies of history and science.
In modern sociological theory, Marxist sociology is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives.

In February 1965, shortly after repudiating the Nation of Islam and its teachings, he was assassinated by three of its members.
Bahrain has a high Human Development Index (ranked 48th in the world) and was recognised by the World Bank as a high income economy.
In 2010, about half of the government was composed of Al Khalifa family.
These moves were described by Amnesty International as representing a "historic period of human rights".
Human rights conditions started to decline by 2007 when torture began to be employed again.
Due to this, Bahrain lost some of the high International rankings it had gained before.
In 2011, Bahrain was criticised for its crackdown on the Arab spring uprising.
;Women's rightsWomen's political rights in Bahrain saw an important step forward when women were granted the right to vote and stand in national elections for the first time in the 2002 election.
Female activist Ghada Jamsheer said "The government used women's rights as a decorative tool on the international level.
In 2006, Lateefa Al Gaood became the first female MP after winning by default.
The number rose to four after the 2011 by-elections.
In 2008, Houda Nonoo was appointed ambassador to the United States making her the first Jewish ambassador of any Arab country.
In 2011, Alice Samaan, a Christian woman was appointed ambassador to the UK.
;Foreign relationsBahrain established bilateral relations with 190 countries worldwide.
As of 2012, Bahrain maintains a network of 25 embassies, 3 consulates and 4 permanent missions to the Arab League, United Nations and European Union respectively.
Bahrain also hosts 36 embassies.
Bahrain plays a modest, moderating role in regional politics and adheres to the views of the Arab League on Middle East peace and Palestinian rights by supporting the two state solution.
Bahrain is also one of the founding members of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Relations with Iran tend to be tense as a result of a failed coup in 1981 which Bahrain blames Iran for and occasional claims of Iranian sovereignty over Bahrain by ultra-conservative elements in the Iranian public.
In 1958, the municipality started water purification projects.
Over the next 30 years, the 4 municipalities were divided into 12 municipalities as settlements such as Hamad Town and Isa Town grew.
The first municipal elections to be held in Bahrain after independence in 1971, was in 2002.
The most recent was in 2010.
Bahrain also has the freest economy in the Middle East and is twelfth freest overall in the world based on the 2011 Index of Economic Freedom published by the Heritage Foundation/"Wall Street Journal".
In 2008, Bahrain was named the world's fastest growing financial center by the City of London's Global Financial Centres Index.
Petroleum production and processing is Bahrain's most exported product, accounting for 60% of export receipts, 70% of government revenues, and 11% of GDP.
Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990–91.
With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain is home to a number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects.
A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007.
Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs.
Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP.
In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations.
Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.
Unemployment, especially among the young, and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic problems.
In 2008, the jobless figure was at 4%, with women over represented at 85% of the total.
;InfrastructureBahrain has one main international airport, the Bahrain International Airport (BIA) which is located on the island of Muharraq, in the north-east.
The airport handled more than 100,000 flights and more than 8 million passengers in 2010.
Bahrain has a well-developed road network, particularly in Manama.
The discovery of oil in the early 1930s accelerated the creation of multiple roads and highways in Bahrain, connecting several isolated villages, such as Budaiya, to Manama.
To the east, a bridge connected Manama to Muharraq since 1929, a new causeway was built in 1941 which replaced the old wooden bridge.
Currently there are three modern bridges connecting the two locations.
Transits between the two islands peaked after the construction of the Bahrain International Airport in 1932.
The four main islands and all the towns and villages are linked by well-constructed roads.
Bahrain's port of Mina Salman is the main seaport of the country and consists of 15 berths.
In 2001, Bahrain had a merchant fleet of eight ships of 1,000 GRT or over, totaling 270,784 GRT.
Private vehicles and taxis are the primary means of transportation in the city.
;TelecommunicationsThe telecommunications sector in Bahrain officially started in 1981 with the establishment of Bahrain's first telecommunications company, Batelco and until 2004, it monopolised the sector.
In 1981, there were more than 45,000 telephones in use in the country.
By 1999, Batelco had more than 100,000 mobile contracts.
In 2002, under pressure from international bodies, Bahrain implemented its telecommunications law which included the establishment of an independent "Telecommunications Regulatory Authority" (TRA).
The country's connectivity score (a statistic which measures both Internet access and fixed and mobile telephone lines) is 210.4 percent per person, while the regional average in Arab States of the Persian Gulf is 135.37 percent.
The number of Bahraini internet users has risen from 40,000 in 2000 to 250,000 in 2008, or from 5.95 to 33 percent of the population.
==Demographics==In 2010, Bahrain's population grew to 1.2 million, of which 568,399 were Bahraini and 666,172 were non-nationals.
Though a majority of the population is Middle Eastern, a sizeable number of people from South Asia live in the country.
Bahrain is the fourth most densely populated sovereign state in the world with a population density of 1,646 people per km2 in 2010.
The only sovereign states with larger population densities are city states.
Much of this population is concentrated in the north of the country with the Southern Governorate being the least densely populated part.
The north of the country is so urbanised that it is considered by some to be one large metropolitan area.
There is a native Christian community in Bahrain.
Alees Samaan, the current Bahraini ambassador to the United Kingdom is a native Christian.
According to the 2001 census, 81.2% of Bahrain's population was Muslim, 10% were Christian, and 9.8% practised Hinduism or other religions.
The 2010 census records that the Muslim proportion had fallen to 70.2% (the 2010 census did not differentiate between the non-Muslim religions).
;HealthBahrain has a universal health care system, dating back to 1960.
Healthcare expenditure accounted for 4.5% of Bahrain's GDP, according to the World Health Organisation.
Bahraini physicians and nurses form a majority of the country's workforce in the health sector, unlike neighbouring Gulf states.
The first hospital in Bahrain was the American Mission Hospital, which opened in 1893 as a dispensary.
The first public hospital, and also tertiary hospital, to open in Bahrain was the Salmaniya Medical Complex, in the Salmaniya district of Manama, in 1957.
Private hospitals are also present throughout the country, such as the International Hospital of Bahrain.
The life expectancy in Bahrain is 73 for males and 76 for females.
Compared to many countries in the region, the prevalence of AIDS and HIV is relatively low.
Malaria and tuberculosis (TB) do not constitute major problems in Bahrain as neither disease is indigenous to the country.
Bahrain also has one of the highest prevalence of diabetes in the world (5th place), with more than 15% of the Bahraini population suffering from the disease, and accounting for 5% of deaths in the country.
Cardiovascular diseases account for 32% of all deaths in Bahrain, being the number one cause of death in the country (the second being cancer).
;HolidaysOn 1 September 2006, Bahrain changed its weekend from being Thursdays and Fridays to Fridays and Saturdays, in order to have a day of the weekend shared with the rest of the world.

Ebola virus disease (EVD; also Ebola hemorrhagic fever, or EHF), or simply Ebola, is a disease of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses.
--> Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches.
--> At this time some people begin to bleed both internally and externally.
The disease has a high risk of death, killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected with an average of about 50 percent.
This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.
The virus spreads by direct contact with body fluids, such as blood, of an infected human or other animals.
This may also occur through contact with an item recently contaminated with bodily fluids.
Spread of the disease through the air between primates, including humans, has not been documented in either laboratory or natural conditions.
Semen or breast milk of a person after recovery from EVD may still carry the virus for several weeks to months.
Fruit bats are believed to be the normal carrier in nature, able to spread the virus without being affected by it.
--> Blood samples are tested for viral RNA, viral antibodies or for the virus itself to confirm the diagnosis.
==Signs and symptoms==The length of time between exposure to the virus and the development of symptoms (incubation period) is between 2 to 21 days, usually between 4 to 10 days.
However, recent estimates based on mathematical models predict that around 5% of cases may take greater than 21 days to develop.
The fever is usually higher than .
In about half of the cases, the skin may develop a maculopapular rash, a flat red area covered with small bumps, 5 to 7 days after symptoms begin.
In some cases, internal and external bleeding may occur.
This typically begins five to seven days after the first symptoms.
Bleeding from mucous membranes or from sites of needle punctures has been reported in 40–50 percent of cases.
Bleeding into the whites of the eyes may also occur.
Recovery may begin between 7 and 14 days after first symptoms.
Death, if it occurs, follows typically 6 to 16 days from first symptoms and is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss.
In general, bleeding often indicates a worse outcome, and blood loss may result in death.
Additionally they develop antibodies against Ebola that last at least 10 years, but it is unclear if they are immune to repeated infections.
The four are Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Taï Forest virus (TAFV) and one simply called Ebola virus (EBOV, formerly Zaire Ebola virus).
The genomes of the five different ebolaviruses (BDBV, EBOV, RESTV, SUDV and TAFV) differ in sequence and the number and location of gene overlaps.
In general, ebolavirions are 80 nanometers (nm) in width and may be as long as 14,000 nm.
===Transmission===Between people, Ebola disease spreads only by direct contact with the blood or body fluids of a person who has developed symptoms of the disease.
The virus is able to survive on objects for a few hours in a dried state, and can survive for a few days within body fluids.
EBOV is thought to infect humans through contact with mucous membranes or through skin breaks.
Once infected, endothelial cells (cells lining the inside of blood vessels), liver cells, and several types of immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells are the main targets of infection.
Macrophages are the first cells infected with the virus, and this infection results in programmed cell death.
Other types of white blood cells, such as lymphocytes, also undergo programmed cell death leading to an abnormally low concentration of lymphocytes in the blood.
This contributes to the weakened immune response seen in those infected with EBOV.
Endothelial cells may be infected within 3 days after exposure to the virus.
The widespread bleeding that occurs in affected people causes swelling and shock due to loss of blood volume.
The presence of viral particles and the cell damage resulting from viruses budding out of the cell causes the release of chemical signals (such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8), which are molecular signals for fever and inflammation.

==Nuclear weapons==It is believed that Israel had possessed an operational nuclear weapons capability by 1967, with the mass production of nuclear warheads occurring immediately after the Six-Day War.
Although no official statistics exist, it has been estimated that Israel possesses from 75 to as many as 400 nuclear weapons, which are reported to include thermonuclear weapons in the megaton range.
The Israeli government maintains a policy of deliberate ambiguity on whether it has nuclear weapons, saying only that it would "not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons in the Middle East.
Israel insisted the material was non-toxic, was to have been used to test filters that protect against chemical weapons, and that it had been clearly listed on the cargo manifest in accordance with international regulations.
The shipment was from a U.S. chemical plant to the IIBR under a U.S. Department of Commerce license.
It is assumed that the Israel Institute for Biological Research in Ness Ziona develops vaccines and antidotes for chemical and biological warfare.
It has not been possible to conclude whether Israel currently maintains an offensive biological weapons program; it is speculated that Israel retains an active ability to produce and disseminate biological weapons.
Politically an African nationalist and democratic socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.
Mandela served 27 years in prison, initially on Robben Island, and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison.
His father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he had been appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate.
A devotee of the god Qamata, Gadla was a polygamist, having four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages.
Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, who was daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of Xhosa.
When Mandela was about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an undiagnosed ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease.
Spending much of his spare time long-distance running and boxing, in his second year Mandela became a prefect.
There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native administration, and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department.
Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the "induna" (headman) discovered he was a runaway.
The company was run by a liberal Jew, Lazar Sidelsky, who was sympathetic to the ANC's cause.
At the firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Redebe, a Xhosa member of the ANC and Communist Party, as well as Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became his first white friend.
In order to save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was a "way station for visiting chiefs", he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland.
In late 1941, Jongintaba visited, forgiving Mandela for running away.
He later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he "simply found myself doing so, and could not do otherwise.
In 1943, Mandela met Anton Lembede, an African nationalist virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists.
In July 1947, Mandela rushed Lembede, who was ill, to hospital, where he died; he was succeeded as ANCYL president by the more moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary.
In the South African general election, 1948, in which only whites were permitted to vote, the Afrikaner-dominated Herenigde Nasionale Party under Daniel François Malan took power, soon uniting with the Afrikaner Party to form the National Party.
In 1950, Mandela was elected national president of the ANCYL; at the ANC national conference of December 1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted.
In April 1952, Mandela began work at the H.M. Basner law firm, though his increasing commitment to work and activism meant he spent less time with his family.
In 1952, the ANC began preparation for a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid with Indian and communist groups, founding a National Voluntary Board to recruit volunteers.
B.
Although the ultra-Africanist Bafabegiya group opposed his candidacy, Mandela was elected regional president in October.
In August 1953, Mandela and Oliver Tambo opened their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg.
The only African-run law firm in the country, it was popular with aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases of police brutality.
In March 1956 he received his third ban on public appearances, restricting him to Johannesburg for five years, but he often defied it.
She withdrew her petition of separation in November, but Mandela filed for divorce in January 1958; the divorce was finalised in March, with the children placed in Evelyn's care.
Representing themselves in court, the accused were freed from prison when the state of emergency was lifted in late August.
===Robben Island: 1964–1982===Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years.
In September 1970 he met British Labour Party MP Dennis Healey.
South African Minister of Justice Jimmy Kruger visited in December 1974, but he and Mandela did not get on.
In 1969, an escape plan for Mandela was developed by Gordon Bruce, but it was abandoned after being infiltrated by an agent of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who hoped to see Mandela shot during the escape.
He was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse, who developed a co-operative relationship with Mandela and was keen to improve prison standards.
By the late 1960s, Mandela's fame had been eclipsed by Steve Biko and the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM).
Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island.
Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments which had control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.
Violence across the country escalated, with many fearing civil war.
Under pressure from an international lobby, multinational banks stopped investing in South Africa, resulting in economic stagnation.
Mandela requested talks with Botha but was denied, instead secretly meeting with Minister of Justice Kobie Coetsee in 1987, having a further 11 meetings over 3 years.
In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial.
Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela.
Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before releasing Mandela unconditionally and legalising all formerly banned political parties on 2 February 1990.
In September 1991 a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg in which Mandela, Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a peace accord, though the violence continued.
Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved.
In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal.
===General election: 1994===With the election set for 27 April 1994, the ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and hiring advisor Stanley Greenberg.
Mandela devoted much time to fundraising for the ANC, touring North America, Europe and Asia to meet wealthy donors, including former supporters of the apartheid regime.
The event was attended by 4000 guests, including world leaders from disparate backgrounds.
Although Mbeki had not been his first choice for the job, Mandela grew to rely heavily on him throughout his presidency, allowing him to organise policy details.
Retaining his Houghton home, he also had a house built in his home village of Qunu, which he visited regularly, walking around the area, meeting with locals, and judging tribal disputes.
They had first met in July 1990, when she was still in mourning, but their friendship grew into a partnership, with Machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits.
===National reconciliation===Presiding over the transition from apartheid minority rule to a multicultural democracy, Mandela saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency.
" He encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks, as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup.
This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as de Klerk later put it, "Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans.
Dedicated in February 1996, it held two years of hearings detailing rapes, torture, bombings, and assassinations, before issuing its final report in October 1998.
Of a population of 40 million, around 23 million lacked electricity or adequate sanitation, 12 million lacked clean water supplies, with 2 million children not in school and a third of the population illiterate.
There was 33% unemployment, and just under half of the population lived below the poverty line.
In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996.
By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.
The Skills Development Act of 1998 provided for the establishment of mechanisms to finance and promote skills development at the workplace.
Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's government of doing little to stem the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive.
Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime, with South Africa having one of the world's highest crime rates; this was a key reason cited for the emigration of 750,000 whites in the late 1990s.
===Foreign affairs===Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation.
In 1996 he was appointed Chairman of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and initiated unsuccessful negotiations to end the First Congo War in Zaire.
Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was scuppered by the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
Mandela faced similar criticism from the West for his personal friendships with Fidel Castro and Muammar Gaddafi.
When Western governments and media criticised these visits, Mandela lambasted such criticism as having racist undertones.
In 2000, the Nelson Mandela Invitational charity golf tournament was founded, hosted by Gary Player.
Mandela was successfully treated for prostate cancer in July 2001.
In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the Mandela Rhodes Foundation was created at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to provide postgraduate scholarships to African students.
These projects were followed by the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory and the 46664 campaign against HIV/AIDS.
He gave the closing address at the XIII International AIDS Conference in Durban in 2000, and in 2004, spoke at the XV International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand.
Mandela announced the formation of this new group, The Elders, in a speech delivered on his 89th birthday.
Mandela's 90th birthday was marked across the country on 18 July 2008, with the main celebrations held at Qunu, and a concert in his honour in Hyde Park, London.
In a speech marking the event, Mandela called for the rich to help the poor across the world.
In 2004, Mandela successfully campaigned for South Africa to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, declaring that there would be "few better gifts for us" in the year marking a decade since the fall of apartheid.
In February 2011, he was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory infection, attracting international attention, before being re-hospitalised for a lung infection and gallstone removal in December 2012.
On 25 June Cape Town Archbishop Thabo Makgoba visited Mandela at the hospital and prayed with Graça Machel Mandela "at this hard time of watching and waiting".
The next day, Zuma visited Mandela in the hospital and cancelled a visit scheduled for the next day to Mozambique.
In the 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, it called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines, and land, believing this necessary to ensure equal distribution of wealth.
Mandela was married three times, fathered six children, had 17 grandchildren, and many great-grandchildren.
Makgatho's son, Mandla Mandela, became chief of the Mvezo tribal council in 2007.
Zindzi was only 18 months old when her father was sent to Robben Island.
In 2004, Johannesburg granted Mandela the freedom of the city, and the Sandton Square shopping centre was renamed Nelson Mandela Square, after a Mandela statue was installed there.
In 2008, another Mandela statue was unveiled at Drakenstein Correctional Centre, formerly Victor Verster Prison, near Cape Town, standing on the spot where Mandela was released from the prison.
In 1993, he received the joint Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
As of January 30, 2009 development was halted with no plans to resume its development.
However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
*1899 – Voting machines are approved by the U.S. Congress for use in federal elections.
Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations.
It was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole, which is about 2000 km away from the magnetic pole.
The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.
In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis (or the northern lights), named after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas, by Galileo in 1619.
Its southern counterpart, the aurora australis (or the southern lights), has features that are almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.
It is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, South America, New Zealand, and Australia.
Auroras also occur on other planets.
Similar to the Earth's aurora, they are also visible close to the planets’ magnetic poles.
Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the eleven-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak.
An electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B.
This angle is known as the “pitch angle” of the particle.
The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius.
The pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere.
Thus it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90 degrees before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there.
Other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes.
These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood.
In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the ones that close through the Earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely.
They discovered that most of the light is produced between 90 and 150 km above the ground, while extending at times to more than 1000 km.
Images of auroras are significantly more common today than in the past due to the increase in use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities.
Due to the different color spectrum present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable.
Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of film can be very important.
Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.
Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field.
David Malin pioneered multiple exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography, recombining the images in the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately.
Predictive techniques are also used, to indicate the extent of the display, a highly useful tool for aurora hunters.
It is possible to take excellent images with standard film (using ISO ratings between 100 and 400) and a single-lens reflex camera with full aperture, a fast lens (f1.4 50 mm, for example), and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on the aurora's brightness.
Early work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the University of Saskatchewan using the SCR-270 radar.
* Red: At the highest altitudes, excited atomic oxygen emits at 630.0 nm (red); low concentration of atoms and lower sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this color visible only under more intense solar activity.
Fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common.
The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to high stability of the N2 molecule) plays its role here as well, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength.
(Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.
) The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100 km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains.
Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the "curtains", show up at the highest levels of solar activity.
It can also cause particles already trapped in the radiation belts to precipitate into the atmosphere.
Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted.
In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator.
As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic"), and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons.
The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere.
The complete process, which also generates an electric ring current around the Earth, is uncertain.
This leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth.
As a result, the solar wind moves magnetic flux (tubes of magnetic field lines, ‘locked’ together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side.
Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone.
===Auroral particles===The immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada reveealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above.
Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone.
The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000 km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere.
These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.
Electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field.
Protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.
===Auroras and the atmosphere ===Auroras result from emissions of photons in the Earth's upper atmosphere, above , from ionized nitrogen atoms regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and nitrogen based molecules returning from an excited state to ground state.
They are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere.
Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:;oxygen emissions: green or orange-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.
;nitrogen emissions: blue or red; blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.
In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125 km); the rest ("region 2") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the "partial ring current" carried by magnetically trapped plasma.
Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms.
In another interpretation the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.
Ionospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary Hall current flow.
By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet.
The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400 km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm3 and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT).
Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraftThe solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity.
The IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind.
That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the Parker spiral.
The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge ("limb") of the visible Sun at any time.
The solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind.
However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them.
Energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere.
As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.
The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth, is typically 190,000 km (30 Re), and on the night side a long "magnetotail" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (> 200 Re).
The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind.
This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines.
The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side.
In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones.
The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.
On 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms.
It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons.
Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth’s axis to the ecliptic plane.
As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees.
Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth’s axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation, changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year.
These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere.
In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.
In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature.
The convergence of magnetic field lines towards the Earth that creates a ‘magnetic mirror’ turns back many of the downward flowing electrons as the field strength increases.
The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector).
It also enhances the electric current.
One early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field and a consequent uni-directional potential drop.
This fact prohibits the concept of a uni-directional potential drop.
The electric field theory proposed for auroral particle acceleration is therefore highly questionable as it appears to violate a basic principle of physics.
A more credible theory is based on acceleration by Landau resonance in the turbulent electric fields of the acceleration region.
This process is essentially the same as that employed in plasma fusion laboratories throughout the world, and appears well able to account in principle for most – if not all – detailed properties of the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of auroras, above, below and within the acceleration region.
Other mechanisms have also been proposed, in particular, Alfvén waves, wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by Hannes Alfvén (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space.
The question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.
Other processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned.
Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen, so that often such auroras are red.
Some O+ ions ("conics") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora.
These ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines.
They therefore start at their "mirror points" and can travel only upward.
In a paper to the Royal Society on 21 November 1861, Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the Carrington-Hodgson flare event when he observed that, "It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken "in the act".
" The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense Carrington-Hodgson white light solar flare on 1 September 1859, produced auroras, so widespread and extraordinarily bright, that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia.
It was reported by the "New York Times" that in Boston on Friday 2 September 1859 the aurora was "so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the light".
One o'clock EST time on Friday 2 September, would have been 6:00 GMT and the self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory was recording the geomagnetic storm, which was then one hour old, at its full intensity.
It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked.
This insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm.
It was also later realized that large electric currents were associated with the aurora, flowing in the region where auroral light originated.
* Walter William Bryant wrote in his book (1920) that Tycho Brahe "seems to have been something of a homœopathist, for he recommends sulfur to cure infectious diseases “brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the Aurora Borealis.
The northern lights have had a number of names throughout history.
In Medieval Europe, the auroras were commonly believed to be a sign from God.
The first Old Norse account of "norðrljós" is found in the Norwegian chronicle "Konungs Skuggsjá" from AD 1230.
The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from Greenland, and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires, that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side, or that glaciers could store energy so that they eventually became fluorescent.
In the traditions of Aboriginal Australians, the Aurora Australis is commonly associated with fire.
For example, the Gunditjmara people of western Victoria called auroras "Puae buae", meaning "ashes", while the Gunai people of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as bushfires in the spirit world.
When the Dieri people of South Australia said that an auroral display was "Kootchee", an evil spirit creating a large fire.
After the Battle of Fredericksburg, the lights could be seen from the battlefield that night.
The Confederate Army took it as a sign that God was on their side during the battle as it was very rare that one could see the Lights in Virginia.
The auroras on the gas giants seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind.
In addition, however, Jupiter's moons, especially Io, are powerful sources of auroras on Jupiter.
These arise from electric currents along field lines ("field aligned currents"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon.
Io, which has active volcanism and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, studied since 1955.
An aurora was also detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard Mars Express.
The total size of the emission region was about 30 km across, and possibly about 8 km high.
By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from Mars Global Surveyor, scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized.
This correlation indicates that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.

This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network.
Internet chat, whether using an IRC chat room, an instant messaging system, or a social networking website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.
Some video games also use multimedia features.
In the Arts there are multimedia artists, whose minds are able to blend techniques using different media that in some way incorporates interaction with the viewer.
Another approach entails the creation of multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena, such as an art gallery.
Computer graphics is a sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content.
Aleppo (; / ALA-LC: "", ) is the largest city in Syria and serves as the capital of Aleppo Governorate, the most populous Syrian governorate.
Many of the current structures date from the 13th century.
We ask::What is the area under the function , in the interval from 0 to 1?
As it is, the true value of the integral must be somewhat less.
Jerusalem (; ; ), located on a plateau in the Judean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea, is one of the oldest cities in the world.
It is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
During its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, attacked 52 times, and captured and recaptured 44 times.
The Old City became a World Heritage site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control.
Jerusalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009.
The unemployment rate in Jerusalem (8.3%) is slightly better than the national average (9.0%), although the civilian labor force accounted for less than half of all persons fifteen years or older—lower in comparison to that of Tel Aviv (58.0%) and Haifa (52.4%).
In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by "Travel + Leisure magazine".
Route 60 runs through the center of the city near the Green Line between East and West Jerusalem.
Other institutions of higher learning in Jerusalem are the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, whose buildings are located on the campuses of the Hebrew University.
According to him, there is no conflict between religion and philosophy, rather that they are different ways of reaching the same truth.
So believe in Allah (as the One, Unique God), and His Messengers (including Jesus, as Messenger); and do not say: (Allah is one of) a trinity.
Currently, IUPAC defines an element to exist if it has isotopes with a lifetime longer than the 10−14 seconds it takes the nucleus to form an electronic cloud.
The heaviest element that is believed to have been synthesized to date is element 118, ununoctium, on 9 October 2006, by the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna, Russia.
Later that day, nine civilians are killed by car bombs in the village of Claudy.
===Isotopes===Naturally occurring iron consists of four stable isotopes: 5.845% of 54Fe, 91.754% of 56Fe, 2.119% of 57Fe and 0.282% of 58Fe.
Possibly the energy released by the decay of 60Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide 26Al, to the remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation 4.6 billion years ago.
Carbon from the oil can diffuse into the steel, making the surface very hard.
Carbon steel contains 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon.
Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1.
Throughout the universe, hydrogen is mostly found in the atomic and plasma states whose properties are quite different from molecular hydrogen.
The theory of relativity, or simply relativity in physics, usually encompasses two theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity.
==Scope==The theory of relativity transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century.
First, special relativity was published in 1905, and the final form of general relativity was published in 1916.
Third, special relativity was accepted in the physics community by 1920.
This theory rapidly became a significant and necessary tool for theorists and experimentalists in the new fields of atomic physics, nuclear physics, and quantum mechanics.
There appeared to be little applicability for experimentalists as most applications were for astronomical scales.
Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been observed</ref> to do so with a half-life of (1.8 ± 0.2)×1018 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year.
The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay, constraining their half-lives to be::182W, t1⁄2 > 1.7×1020 years:183W, t1⁄2 > 8×1019 years:184W, t1⁄2 > 1.8×1020 years:186W, t1⁄2 > 4.1×1018 yearsAnother 30 artificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been characterized, the most stable of which are 181W with a half-life of 121.2 days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1 days, 188W with a half-life of 69.4 days, 178W with a half-life of 21.6 days, and 187W with a half-life of 23.72 h. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 3 hours, and most of these have half-lives below 8 minutes.
The remnants of the Palestine Potash Company were nationalised and Dead Sea Works Ltd. was established in 1952 in its stead as a state-owned company to extract potash and other minerals from the Dead Sea.
In 1995, the company was privatized and it is currently owned by Israel Chemicals.
The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea chemicals industry could generate $918m incremental value added per year, "almost equivalent to the contribution of the entire manufacturing sector of Palestinian territories today".
The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea tourism industry could generate $290 million of revenues per year and 2,900 jobs.
The bull was a symbol of the southern Italic tribes and was often depicted goring the Roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free Italy during the Social War.
In the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful war was declared on Austria.
Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a dictatorship.
===Republican Italy===Italy became a republic after a referendum held on 2 June 1946, a day celebrated since as Republic Day.
The Republican Constitution was approved on 1 January 1948.
To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula and the two Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Sardinia, in addition to many smaller islands.
Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Mozambique, and East Timor and provides support for NATO and UN operations in Bosnia, Kosovo and Albania.
Italy deployed over 2,000 troops in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) from February 2003.
The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 87% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 13% live in the southern half of the peninsula.
German has the same status in South Tyrol as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino, does Ladin.
===Religion===Roman Catholicism is, by far, the largest religion in the country, although Catholicism is no longer officially the state religion.
One of the longest-established minority religious faiths in Italy is Judaism, Jews having been present in Ancient Rome since before the birth of Christ.
In addition, there are more than 200,000 followers of faiths originating in the Indian subcontinent with some 70,000 Sikhs with 22 gurdwaras across the country, 70,000 Hindus, and 50,000 Buddhists.
Italy has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites (50) than any other country in the world, and has rich collections of art, culture and literature from many different periods.
British architect Inigo Jones, inspired by the designs of Italian buildings and cities, brought back the ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture to 17th-century England, being inspired by Andrea Palladio.
Italian opera was believed to have been founded in the early 17th century, in Italian cities such as Mantua and Venice.
La Scala operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world.
===Cinema===The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the Lumière brothers began motion picture exhibitions.
In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy.
===Cuisine===Modern Italian cuisine has developed through centuries of social and political changes, with roots as far back as the 4th century BC.
Growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression culminated in the Iranian Revolution, which led to the establishment of an Islamic republic on 1 April 1979.
In 550 BC, Cyrus the Great from the state of Anshan took over the Median empire, and founded the Achaemenid empire by unifying other city states.
The empire had a centralised, bureaucratic administration under the Emperor and a large professional army and civil services, inspiring similar developments in later empires.
In the middle of the 2nd century BC, the Parthian Empire rose to become the main power in Iran and continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries until 224 CE, when it was succeeded by the Sassanid Empire.
===Middle Ages (652–1501)===The prolonged Byzantine-Persian wars, as well as social conflict within the Empire opened the way for an Arab invasion of Iran in the 7th century.
Gundeshapur was the most important medical centre of the ancient world at the time of the Islamic conquest.
The process of conversion of Iranians to Islam which followed was prolonged and gradual.
The mawali formed the majority of the rebel army, which was led by the Iranian general Abu Muslim.
The blossoming Persian literature, philosophy, medicine, and art became major elements in the forming of a Muslim civilization during the Islamic Golden Age.
The Islamic Golden Age reached its peak in the 10th and 11th centuries, during which Persia was the main theatre of scientific activity.
The cultural revival that began in the Abbasid period led to a resurfacing of Iranian national identity, and so earlier attempts of Arabization never succeeded in Iran.
The Iranian Shuubiyah movement became a catalyst for Iranians to regain their independence in their relations with the Arab invaders.
The Safavid era also saw the start of the creation of new layers in Persian society, composed of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Georgians, Circassians, Armenians, and other peoples of the Caucasus.
In 1729, an Iranian Khorasan chieftain and military genius, Nader Shah, successfully drove out, then conquered the Pashtun invaders.
Nader Shah's assassination sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil, after which Karim Khan came to power in 1750, bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity.
Around 1.5 million people, or 20–25% of Persia's population, died as a result of the Great Persian Famine of 1870–1871.
On the pretext of restoring order, the Russians occupied northern Iran in 1911.
During World War I, the British occupied much of western Iran, not fully withdrawing until 1921.
In 1921, Reza Khan, Prime Minister of Iran and former general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, overthrew the Qajar Dynasty and became Shah.
He became enormously popular in Iran after he nationalized Iran's petroleum industry and oil reserves.
Arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police, SAVAK, were used to crush all forms of political opposition.
After his release in 1964, Khomeini publicly criticized the United States government.
The Shah sent him into exile.
He went first to Turkey, then to Iraq and finally to France.
===After the Iranian Revolution (1979–)===The Iranian Revolution, later known as the Islamic Revolution, began in January 1978 with the first major demonstrations against the Shah.
A new government was formed and in April 1979 Iran officially became an Islamic Republic, after its establishment was supported in a referendum.
A second referendum in December 1979 approved a theocratic constitution.
The 2005 presidential election brought the conservative populist candidate, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to power.
During the 2009 Iranian presidential election the Interior Ministry announced incumbent president Ahmadinejad had won 62.63% of the vote, while Mir-Hossein Mousavi had come in second place with 33.75%.
Iran has one of the highest urban growth rates in the world.
From 1950 to 2002, the urban proportion of the population increased from 27% to 60%.
The United Nations predicts that by 2030, 80% of the population will be urban.
The listed populations are from the 2006/07 (1385 AP) census.
Tehran, with a population of 7,705,036, is the largest city in Iran and is the capital.
Tehran, like many big cities, suffers from severe air pollution.
It is the hub of the country's communication and transport network.
It is the centre of tourism in Iran, and between 15 and 20 million pilgrims go to the Imam Reza's shrine every year.
Another major Iranian city is Isfahan (population 1,583,609), which is the capital of Isfahan Province.
The city contains a wide variety of Islamic architectural sites ranging from the 11th to the 19th century.
The fourth major city of Iran is Tabriz (population 1,378,935), the capital of the East Azerbaijan Province.
It is also the second industrial city of Iran after Tehran.
Tabriz had been the second largest city in Iran until the late 1960s and one of its former capitals and residence of the crown prince under the Qajar dynasty.
The fifth major city is Karaj (population 1,377,450), located in Alborz Province and situated 20 km west of Tehran, at the foot of the Alborz mountains; however, the city is increasingly becoming an extension of metropolitan Tehran.
The sixth major Iranian city is Shiraz (population 1,214,808); it is the capital of Fars Province.
The ancient Persians were present in the region from about the 9th century BC, and became rulers of a large empire under the Achaemenid dynasty in the 6th century BC.
The ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae, two of the four capitals of the Achaemenid Empire, are located in or near Shiraz.
UNESCO declared the citadel of Persepolis a World Heritage Site in 1979.
In 2004, a large share of natural gas reserves in Iran were untapped.
Of that amount, about 75% was based on natural gas, 18% on oil, and 7% on hydroelectric power.
Demographic trends and intensified industrialization have caused electric power demand to grow by 8% per year.
Iran’s first nuclear power plant at Bushehr went online in 2011.
The Ennahda Movement, formerly banned under the Ben Ali regime, won a plurality of 90 seats out of a total of 217.
In March 2012, Ennahda declared it will not support making sharia the main source of legislation in the new constitution, maintaining the secular nature of the state.
Such settlements currently exist in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and in the Golan Heights.
Israeli neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and communities in the Golan Heights, the latter of which has been annexed by Israel, are also considered settlements by the international community, which does not recognise Israel's annexations of these territories.
The International Court of Justice also says these settlements are illegal in a 2004 advisory opinion.
Settlements range in character from farming communities and frontier villages to urban suburbs and neighborhoods.
In 1932 the French moved their military academy from Damascus to Homs, and it remained the only military academy in Syria until 1967.

At first, this was a play on words, as Abba is also the name of a well-known fish-canning company in Sweden, and itself an acronym.
Adolf Hitler (; 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party ( (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party).
Hitler received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich.
On 28–29 March 1938, Hitler held a series of secret meetings in Berlin with Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten "Heimfront" (Home Front), the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland.
Britain, whose troops were forced to evacuate France by sea from Dunkirk, continued to fight alongside other British dominions in the Battle of the Atlantic.
Many scholars such as Jerome visited the school of Alexandria to exchange ideas and to communicate directly with its scholars.

The largest number of member states was 58, between 28 September 1934 (when Ecuador joined) and 23 February 1935 (when Paraguay withdrew).
Three of these members had been made Council members the day before the vote (South Africa, Bolivia, and Egypt).
Brazil was the first founding member to withdraw (14 June 1926), and Haiti the last (April 1942).
With the exception of the Kingdom of Iraq, which joined the League on 3 October 1932, these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the Second World War, in a process that did not end until 1990.
Following the demise of the League, most of the remaining mandates became United Nations Trust Territories.
In addition to the mandates, the League itself governed the Territory of the Saar Basin for 15 years, before it was returned to Germany following a plebiscite, and the Free City of Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland) from 15 November 1920 to 1 September 1939.
The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League.
After the First World War, Poland laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of Prussia.
The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered.
The Klaipėda Convention was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania.
A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq.
In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population.
During the Polish–Soviet War, Lithuania signed the Moscow Peace Treaty with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania's frontiers.
As part of this treaty, the border town of Leticia and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the Amazon River.
==Other conflicts==In addition to territorial disputes, the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between and within nations.
Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926.
In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour.
Under the terms of an agreed lease, the Japanese government had the right to station its troops in the area around the South Manchurian Railway, a major trade route between the two countries, in the Chinese region of Manchuria.
In 1932, Japanese air and sea forces bombarded the Chinese city of Shanghai, sparking the January 28 Incident.
The League of Nations agreed to a request for help from the Chinese government, but the long voyage by ship delayed League officials.
When they arrived, they were confronted with Chinese assertions that the Japanese had invaded unlawfully, while the Japanese claimed they were acting to keep peace in the area.
Before the report could be voted on by the Assembly, Japan announced its intention to push further into China.
The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000 casualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000 dead for Paraguay, whose population was approximately one million.
It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster.
On 5 October and later on 29 February 1936, the United States endeavoured, with limited success, to limit its exports of oil and other materials to normal peacetime levels.
The League sanctions were lifted on 4 July 1936, but by that point Italy had already gained control of the urban areas of Abyssinia.
The League members, however, would not intervene in the Spanish Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict.
Western countries were sympathetic to the Chinese in their struggle, particularly in their stubborn defence of Shanghai, a city with a substantial number of foreigners.
In 1933, Japan simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgement, as did Germany the same year (using the failure of the World Disarmament Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext), and Italy in 1937.
The final significant act of the League was to expel the Soviet Union in December 1939 after it invaded Finland.
===Global representation===Representation at the League was often a problem.
In January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War.
Italy also began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1937.
Immediately after the First World War, pacifism became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries.
At the 1943 Tehran Conference, the Allied powers agreed to create a new body to replace the League: the United Nations.
The designers of the structures of the United Nations intended to make it more effective than the League.
The final meeting of the League of Nations took place on 12 April 1946 in Geneva.
Paul Joseph Goebbels (; ; 29 October 1897 – 1 May 1945) was a German politician and Reich Minister of Propaganda in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945.
Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events.
Albania (, , or sometimes , ; ; ), officially known as the Republic of Albania (; ), is a country in Southeastern Europe.
It is less than from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which links the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea.
Albania is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the World Trade Organization.
=== Executive branch ===The head of state in Albania is the President of the Republic.
The current President of the Republic is Bujar Nishani elected in July 2012.
There are 15 permanent commissions, or committees.
Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years.
The lowlands of the west face the Adriatic Sea.
The 70% of the country that is mountainous is rugged and often inaccessible from the outside.
The three largest and deepest tectonic lakes of the Balkan Peninsula are partly located in Albania.
In the southern lowlands, temperatures average about higher throughout the year.
The difference is greater than during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.
Average precipitation is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the Mediterranean Sea and the continental air mass.
Nearly 95% of the rain falls in the winter.
Rainfall in the upland mountain ranges is heavier.
The seasonal variation is not quite as great in the coastal area.
Since the collapse of the former regime, there has been a considerable increase in car ownership and bus usage.
Whilst some of the country's roads are still in very poor condition, there have been other developments (such as the construction of a motorway between Tirana and Durrës) which have taken much traffic away from the railways.
Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992.
)Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian.
The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South.
The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.
"Meshari" (The Missal) by Gjon Buzuku, published in 1555, is considered the first literary work of written Albanian.
The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood.
The earliest evidence dates from 1332 AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, Archbishop of Antivari, who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin.
Schools were scarce between World War I and World War II.
Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male literacy rate is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%.
There are also nursing schools in other cities.
The main meal of Albanians is the midday meal, which is usually accompanied by a salad of fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers and olives with olive oil, vinegar and salt.
Ukraine (; , transliterated: , ) is a country in Eastern Europe.
In 1654, Khmelnytsky signed the Treaty of Pereyaslav, forming a military and political alliance with Russia that acknowledged loyalty to the tsar.
From 1737 to 1834, expansion into the northern Black Sea littoral and the eastern Danube valley was a cornerstone of Russian foreign policy.
At a later period, tsarists established a policy of Russification, suppressing the use of the Ukrainian language in print, and in public.
Ukrainians entered World War I on the side of both the Central Powers, under Austria, and the Triple Entente, under Russia.
During the war, Austro-Hungarian authorities established the Ukrainian Legion to fight against the Russian Empire.
This led to civil war, and an anarchist movement called the Black Army led by Nestor Makhno, developed in Southern Ukraine during that war.
Scholars are divided as to whether this famine fits the definition of genocide, but the Ukrainian parliament and other countries recognise it as such.
The Communist leadership perceived famine as a means of class struggle and used starvation as a punishment tool to force peasants into collective farms.
Largely the same groups were responsible for the mass killing operations during the civil war, collectivisation, and the Great Terror.
Evdokimov transferred into Communist Party administration in 1934, when he became Party secretary for North Caucasus Krai.
All these territorial gains were internationally recognised by the Paris peace treaties of 1947.
More than 600,000 Soviet soldiers (or one-quarter of the Soviet Western Front) were killed or taken captive there.
In total, the number of ethnic Ukrainians who fought in the ranks of the Soviet Army is estimated from 4.5 million to 7 million.
By 1950, the republic had fully surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production.
As a result, the Ukrainian workforce rose 33.2% from 1940 to 1955 while industrial output grew 2.2 times in that same period.
Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite.
On 26 April 1986, a reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded, resulting in the Chernobyl disaster, the worst nuclear reactor accident in history.
At the time of the accident, 7 million people lived in the contaminated territories, including 2.2 million in Ukraine.
This started a period of confrontation with the central Soviet authorities.
In August 1991, a conservative faction among the Communist leaders of the Soviet Union attempted a coup to remove Mikhail Gorbachev and to restore the Communist party's power.
However, the country experienced deeper economic slowdown than some of the other former Soviet Republics.
During the recession, Ukraine lost 60% of its GDP from 1991 to 1999, and suffered five-digit inflation rates.
The Ukrainian economy stabilized by the end of the 1990s.
A new currency, the hryvnia, was introduced in 1996.
=== Orange Revolution ===In 2004, Viktor Yanukovych, then Prime Minister, was declared the winner of the presidential elections, which had been largely rigged, as the Supreme Court of Ukraine later ruled.
The results caused a public outcry in support of the opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, who challenged the outcome.
On 1 March 2014, exiled Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych requested that Russia use military forces "to establish legitimacy, peace, law and order, stability and defending the people of Ukraine".
On 6 March 2014, the Crimean Parliament voted to "enter into the Russian Federation with the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation" and later held a referendum asking the people of these regions whether they wanted to join Russia as a federal subject, or if they wanted to restore the 1992 Crimean constitution and Crimea's status as a part of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, unrest began in the Eastern and Southern regions of Ukraine.
Ukraine ratified the treaty in 1994, and by 1996 the country became free of nuclear weapons.
Ukraine took consistent steps toward reduction of conventional weapons.
It signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which called for reduction of tanks, artillery, and armoured vehicles (army forces were reduced to 300,000).
Following independence, Ukraine declared itself a neutral state.
The country has had a limited military partnership with Russian Federation, other CIS countries and a partnership with NATO since 1994.
In 1991, the government liberalised most prices to combat widespread product shortages, and was successful in overcoming the problem.
The loose monetary policies of the early 1990s pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels.
For the year 1993, Ukraine holds the world record for inflation in one calendar year.
Those living on fixed incomes suffered the most.
Prices stabilised only after the introduction of new currency, the hryvnia, in 1996.
The country was also slow in implementing structural reforms.
However, widespread resistance to reforms within the government and from a significant part of the population soon stalled the reform efforts.
In the early 2000s, the economy showed strong export-based growth of 5 to 10%, with industrial production growing more than 10% per year.
Ukraine was hit by the economic crisis of 2008 and in November 2008, the IMF approved a stand-by loan of $16.5 billion for the country.
By July 2008 the average nominal salary in Ukraine reached 1,930 hryvnias per month.
Since independence, Ukraine has maintained its own space agency, the National Space Agency of Ukraine (NSAU).
Between 1991 and 2007, Ukraine has launched six self made satellites and 101 launch vehicles, and continues to design spacecraft.
The country imports most energy supplies, especially oil and natural gas and to a large extent depends on Russia as its energy supplier.
While 25% of the natural gas in Ukraine comes from internal sources, about 35% comes from Russia and the remaining 40% from Central Asia through transit routes that Russia controls.
At the same time, 85% of the Russian gas is delivered to Western Europe through Ukraine.
Significant issues include underdeveloped infrastructure and transportation, corruption and bureaucracy.
In 2007 the Ukrainian stock market recorded the second highest growth in the world of 130 percent.
The Seven Wonders of Ukraine and Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine are the selection of the most important landmarks of Ukraine, chosen by the general public through an internet-based vote.
==Demographics==According to the Ukrainian Census of 2001, Ukrainians make up 77.8% of the population.
The industrial regions in the east and southeast are the most heavily populated, and about 67.2% of the population lives in urban areas.
In 2007, the country's rate of population decline was the fourth highest in the world.
Infant mortality rates have also dropped from 10.4 deaths to 8.3 per 1,000 children under one year of age.
Ukraine, where total fertility (a very low 1.1 in 2001), was one of the world's lowest, shows that there is more than one pathway to lowest-low fertility.
Analysis of official national statistics and the Ukrainian Reproductive Health Survey show that fertility declined to very low levels without a transition to a later pattern of childbearing.
Findings from focus group interviews suggest explanations of the early fertility pattern.
These findings include the persistence of traditional norms for childbearing and the roles of men and women, concerns about medical complications and infertility at a later age, and the link between early fertility and early marriage.
The demographic trend is showing signs of improvement, as the birth rate has been steadily growing since 2001.
In 2007 the highest birth rates were in the western oblasts.
Protestants in Ukraine form around 2.19 percent of the population.
There are 487 registered Muslim communities, 368 of them on Crimea.
The Jewish population is a tiny fraction of what it was before World War II.
The largest Jewish communities in 1926 were in Odessa, 154,000 or 36.5% of the total population; and Kiev, 140,500 or 27.3%.
===Education===According to the Ukrainian constitution, access to free education is granted to all citizens.
Complete general secondary education is compulsory in the state schools which constitute the overwhelming majority.
Free higher education in state and communal educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis.
There is also a small number of accredited private secondary and higher education institutions.
Because of the Soviet Union's emphasis on total access of education for all citizens, which continues today, the literacy rate is an estimated 99.4%.
Since 2005, an eleven-year school programme has been replaced with a twelve-year one: primary education takes four years to complete (starting at age six), middle education (secondary) takes five years to complete; upper secondary then takes three years.
Among the Ukrainians that rose to the highest offices in the Russian Empire were Aleksey Razumovsky, Alexander Bezborodko and Ivan Paskevich.
Among the Ukrainians who greatly influenced the Russian Orthodox Church in this period were Stephen Yavorsky, Feofan Prokopovich and Dimitry of Rostov.
b.
See the Great Purge article for details.
c. Estimates on the number of deaths vary.
Official Soviet data is not available because the Soviet government denied the existence of the famine.
See the Holodomor article for details.
Sources differ on interpreting various statements from different branches of different governments as to whether they amount to the official recognition of the Famine as Genocide by the country.
For example, after the statement issued by the Latvian Sejm on 13 March 2008, the total number of countries is given as 19 (according to "Ukrainian BBC": ), 16 (according to "Korrespondent", Russian edition: ), "more than 10" (according to "Korrespondent", Ukrainian edition: ) Retrieved 27 January 2008.d. These figures are likely to be much higher, as they do not include Ukrainians from nations or Ukrainian Jews, but instead only ethnic Ukrainians, from the Ukrainian SSR.
e. This figure excludes POW deaths.
f. According to the official 2001 census data (by nationality; by language) about 75 percent of Kiev's population responded 'Ukrainian' to the native language (ridna mova) census question, and roughly 25 percent responded 'Russian'.
On the other hand, when the question 'What language do you use in everyday life?
' was asked in the 2003 sociological survey, the Kievans' answers were distributed as follows: 'mostly Russian': 52 percent, 'both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure': 32 percent, 'mostly Ukrainian': 14 percent, 'exclusively Ukrainian': 4.3 percent.
g. Such writings were also the base for Russian and Belarusian literature.
h. Without the city of Inhulets.
The people of Uganda were hunter-gatherers until 1,700 to 2,300 years ago, when Bantu-speaking populations migrated to the southern parts of the country.
Uganda gained independence from Britain on 9 October 1962.
However, much of the south is poorly drained, while the centre is dominated by Lake Kyoga, which is also surrounded by extensive marshy areas.
Uganda lies almost completely within the Nile basin.
The Victoria Nile drains from Lake Victoria into Lake Kyoga and thence into Lake Albert on the Congolese border.
It then runs northwards into South Sudan.
One small area on the eastern edge of Uganda is drained by the Turkwel River, part of the internal drainage basin of Lake Turkana.
Southern Uganda is wetter with rain generally spread throughout the year.
At Entebbe on the northern shore of Lake Victoria, most rain falls from March to June and in the November/December period.
Further to the north a dry season gradually emerges; at Gulu about from the South Sudanese border, November to February is much drier than the rest of the year.
===Environment and conservation===Uganda has 60 protected areas, including ten national parks: Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and Rwenzori Mountains National Park (both UNESCO World Heritage Sites), Kibale National Park, Kidepo Valley National Park, Lake Mburo National Park, Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, Mount Elgon National Park, Kenya National Park, Murchison Falls National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park, and Semuliki National Park.
It is bordered by Eritrea to the north and northeast, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south.
Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century.
In the first century AD the Aksumite Empire emerged in what is now northern Ethiopia and Eritrea.
Aksum would later at times extend its rule into Yemen on the other side of the Red Sea.
The name of the dynasty is derived from the Cushitic-speaking Agaw of northern Ethiopia.
In the early 15th century, Ethiopia sought to make diplomatic contact with European kingdoms for the first time since Aksumite times.
A letter from King Henry IV of England to the Emperor of Abyssinia survives.
This Abyssinian–Adal War was also one of the first proxy wars in the region, as the Ottoman Empire and Portugal took sides in the conflict.
When Emperor Susenyos I converted to Roman Catholicism in 1624, years of revolt and civil unrest followed, resulting in thousands of deaths.
On 25 June 1632 Emperor Fasilides, Susenyos's son, declared the state religion again to be Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity.
Chief among these was the Yejju dynasty, which included Aligaz of Yejju and his brother Ali I of Yejju.
Menelik had signed the Treaty of Wichale with Italy in May 1889 in which Italy would recognize Ethiopia's sovereignty so long as Italy could control an area north of Ethiopia (part of modern Eritrea).
In return Italy was to provide Menelik with arms and support him as emperor.
The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to expand their territorial claims.
About a third of the population died in the Great Ethiopian Famine (1888 to 1892).
Following Zewditu's death, he was made Emperor on 2 November 1930.
During this time, Haile Selassie appealed to the League of Nations in 1935, delivering an address that made him a worldwide figure, and the 1935 "Time" magazine Man of the Year.
Also in this period, 1937, was the Italian massacre of Yekatit 12.
Following the entry of Italy into World War II, British Empire forces, together with patriot Ethiopian fighters, officially liberated Ethiopia in the course of the East African Campaign in 1941.
Ethiopia had between two and four million slaves in the early 20th century, out of a total population of about eleven million.
Opinion within Ethiopia turned against Haile Selassie I owing to the worldwide oil crisis of 1973, which caused a sharp increase in gasoline prices starting on 13 February 1974; food shortages; uncertainty regarding the succession; border wars, and discontent in the middle class created through modernization.
The high gasoline prices caused the taxi drivers and teachers to go on strike on 18 February 1974.
Students and workers in Addis Ababa began demonstrating against the government on 20 February 1974.
A new government was formed with Endelkachew Makonnen serving as Prime Minister.
In 1977, the Ogaden War resulted in Somalia capturing part of the Ogaden region.
Ethiopia recovered it after receiving massive military aid from the USSR, Cuba, South Yemen, East Germany and North Korea.
This included around 15,000 Cuban combat troops.
Up to 500,000 were killed as a result of the Red Terror, from forced deportations, or from the use of hunger as a weapon under Mengistu's rule.
Numerous other top leaders of his were also found guilty of war crimes.
Numerous former officials received the death sentence and tens of others spent the next 20 years in jail, before being pardoned from life sentences.
In the beginning of the 1980s, a series of famines hit Ethiopia that affected around 8 million people, resulting in 1 million dead.
This resulted in more economic hardship and the collapse of the military in the face of determined onslaughts by guerrilla forces in the north.
The collapse of communism in general, and in Eastern Europe during the Revolutions of 1989, coincided with the Soviet Union stopping aid to Ethiopia altogether in 1990.
In May 1991, EPRDF forces advanced on Addis Ababa and the Soviet Union did not intervene to save the government side.
Mengistu fled the country to asylum in Zimbabwe, where he still resides.
In June 1992, the Oromo Liberation Front withdrew from the government; in March 1993, members of the Southern Ethiopia Peoples' Democratic Coalition also left the government.
In May 1998, a border dispute with Eritrea led to the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, which lasted until June 2000 and cost both countries an estimated $1 million a day.
On 15 May 2005, Ethiopia held a third multiparty election, which was highly disputed, with some opposition groups claiming fraud.
The opposition parties gained more than 200 parliamentary seats, compared with just 12 in the 2000 elections.
A coalition of opposition parties and some individuals was established in 2009 to oust the regime of the EPRDF in legislative elections of 2010.
The opposition won most votes in Addis Ababa, but the EPRDF halted counting of votes for several days.
Full recovery from the drought's effects are not expected until 2012, with long-term strategies by the national government in conjunction with development agencies believed to offer the most sustainable results.
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi died on 20 August 2012 in Brussels, where he was being treated for an unspecified illness.
Hailemariam will remain in the position until new elections in 2015.
In 2013, the mass deportation from Saudi Arabia of Ethiopian migrant workers has caused tensions.
Lake Tana in the north is the source of the Blue Nile.
The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.
===Climate===The predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation.
The Ethiopian Highlands cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator.
There are on average 7 hours of sunshine per day, meaning it is sunny for around 60% of the available time.
The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine.
Most major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate.
In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier.
The African Wild Dog prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory.
However, with last sightings at Fincha, this canid is thought to be potentially extirpated within Ethiopia.
The Ethiopian wolf is perhaps the most researched of all the endangered species within Ethiopia.
Ethiopia is a global center of avian diversity.
To date more than 856 bird species have been recorded in Ethiopia, 20 of which are endemic to the country.
Habitat destruction is a factor that leads to endangerment.
When changes to a habitat occur rapidly, animals do not have time to adjust.
Human impact threatens many species, with greater threats expected as a result of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions.
With carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 of 6,494,000 tonnes, Ethiopia contributes just 0.02% to the annual human-caused release of greenhouse gases.
Ethiopia has a large number of species listed as critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable to global extinction.
The threatened species in Ethiopia can be broken down into three categories (based on IUCN ratings): Critically Endangered, Endangered, and Vulnerable.
===Deforestation===Deforestation is a major concern for Ethiopia as studies suggest loss of forest contributes to soil erosion, loss of nutrients in the soil, loss of animal habitats and reduction in biodiversity.
At the beginning of the 20th century around 420 000 km² or 35% of Ethiopia's land was covered by trees but recent research indicates that forest cover is now approximately 11.9% of the area.
Ethiopia is one of the seven fundamental and independent centers of origin of cultivated plants of the world.
Between 1990 and 2005 the country lost approximately 21 000 km².
Organizations such as SOS and Farm Africa are working with the federal government and local governments to create a system of forest management.
Working with a grant of approximately 2.3 million euros the Ethiopian government recently began training people on reducing erosion and using proper irrigation techniques that do not contribute to deforestation.
This project is assisting more than 80 communities.
==Demographics==Ethiopia's population has grown from 33.5 million in 1983 to 87.9 million in 2014.
The population was only about 9 million in the 19th century.
The 2007 Population and Housing Census results show that the population of Ethiopia grew at an average annual rate of 2.6% between 1994 and 2007, down from 2.8% during the period 1983–1994.
Currently, the population growth rate is among the top ten countries in the world.
The population is forecast to grow to over 210 million by 2060, which would be an increase from 2011 estimates by a factor of about 2.5.
According to the Ethiopian national census of 2007, the Oromo are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, at 34.4% of the nation's population.
The Amhara represent 27.0% of the country's inhabitants, while the Somali and Tigray represent 6.22% and 6.08% of the population, respectively.
Other prominent ethnic groups are as follows: Sidama 4.00%, Gurage 2.52%, Welayta 2.27%, Afar 1.73%, Hadiya 1.72%, Gamo 1.49% and others 12.6%.
The Arabic form of this term (Al-Habasha) is the etymological basis of "Abyssinia," the former name of Ethiopia in English and other European languages.
The largest ethnic groups among these include the Nuer and Anuak.
The majority of this population came from Somalia (approximately 64,300 persons), Eritrea (41,700) and Sudan (25,900).
The Ethiopian government required nearly all refugees to live in refugee camps.
==Health==According to the head of the World Bank's Global HIV/AIDS Program, Ethiopia has only 1 medical doctor per 100,000 people.
However, the World Health Organization's 2006 World Health Report gives a figure of 1,936 physicians (for 2003), which comes to about 2.6 per 100,000.
Globalization is said to affect the country, with many educated professionals leaving Ethiopia for better economic opportunities in the West.
Birth rates, infant mortality rates, and death rates are lower in cities than in rural areas owing to better access to education, medicines and hospitals.
Life expectancy is higher at 53, compared to 48 in rural areas.
Despite sanitation being a problem, use of improved water sources is also on the rise; 81% in cities compared to 11% in rural areas.
There are 119 hospitals (12 in Addis Ababa alone) and 412 health centers in Ethiopia.
Ethiopia has a relatively low average life expectancy of 58 years.
Infant mortality rates are relatively very high, as over 8% of infants die during or shortly after childbirth, (although this is a dramatic decrease from 16% in 1965) while birth-related complications such as obstetric fistula affect many of the nation's women.
The most affected are poor communities and women, due to lack of health education, empowerment, awareness and lack of social well-being.
The government of Ethiopia and many private organizations like World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations, are launching campaigns and are working aggressively to improve Ethiopia's health conditions and promote health awareness on AIDS and other communicable diseases (Dugassa, 2005).
Many believe that sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea result from touching a stone after a female dog urinates on it and there is a general belief that these diseases are caused by bad spirits and supernatural causes.
Others believe that eating the reproductive organs of a black goat will help expel the diseases from those same organ in their body (Kater, 2000).
Ethiopia has high infant and maternal mortality rate.
Only a minority of Ethiopians are born in hospitals; most of them are born in rural households.
Those who are expected to give birth at home have elderly women serve as midwives assist with the delivery (Kater, 2000) The increase in infant and maternal mortality rate is believed to be due to lack of women's involvement in household decision-making, immunization and social capital (Fantahun, Berhane, Wall, Byass, & Hogberg, 2007).
The low availability of health care professionals with modern medical training, together with lack of funds for medical services, leads to the preponderancy of less reliable traditional healers that use home-based therapies to heal common ailments.
FGC is least prevalent in the regions of Tigray and Gambela, where 29% and 27% of girls and women, respectively, are affected.
==Education==Education in Ethiopia had been dominated by the Orthodox Church for many centuries until secular education was adopted in the early 1900s.The current system follows very similar school expansion schemes to the rural areas as the previous 1980s system with an addition of deeper regionalization giving rural education in their own languages starting at the elementary level and with more budget allocated to the education sector.
The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, four years of lower secondary school and two years of higher secondary school.
In 2004 school enrollment was more than that of many other African countries.
Everyone is addressed by his/her given name.
===Calendar===Ethiopia has several local calendars.
It is based on the older Alexandrian or Coptic calendar, which in turn derives from the Egyptian calendar.
Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six epagomenal days, which comprise a thirteenth month.
Like the Julian calendar, the sixth epagomenal day — which in essence is a leap day — is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day.
Thus the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1 Mäskäräm, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September (Gregorian), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year.
Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent) and Gurrandala (small crescent).
===Time===Time in Ethiopia is counted differently from in many Western countries.
To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) 6 hours to the Western time.
For example, 2 AM local Addis Ababa time is called "8 at night" in Ethiopia, while 8 PM is called "2 in the evening".
Almost universally in Ethiopia, it is common to eat from the same dish in the center of the table with a group of people.
Chechebsa (ጨጨብሣ), marqa, chukko, michirra and dhanga are the most popular dishes from the Oromo.
Kitfo (ክትፎ), which originated from the Gurage is one of the widely accepted and favorite foods in Ethiopia.
===Music===The music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse, with each of the country's 80 ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds.
Ethiopian music uses a distinct modal system that is pentatonic, with characteristically long intervals between some notes.
As with many other aspects of Ethiopian culture and tradition, tastes in music and lyrics are strongly linked with those in neighboring Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti and Sudan.
===Sport===The main sports in Ethiopia are athletics (particularly long distance running) and football (soccer).
As of 2012 going into 2013 the current national Ethiopian football team (Walyia Antelopes) has made itself history by qualifying for the 2012 African Cup of Nations (CAF) and more recently by reaching the last 10 African football teams in the last stage of qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Ethiopia has Sub-Saharan Africa's longest basketball tradition as it established a national basketball team as early as 1949.

Belgium's two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in the north and the French-speaking southern region of Wallonia.
Historically, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were known as the Low Countries; it once covered a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states.
The region was called Belgica in Latin, after the Roman province of Gallia Belgica, which covered more or less the same area.
==Demographics==Almost all of the Belgian population is urban—97% in 2004.
The population density of Belgium is 365 per square kilometre (952 per square mile) as of March 2013.
As of 2007, nearly 92% of the population had Belgian citizenship, and other European Union member citizens account for around 6%.
In 2007, there were 1.38 million foreign-born residents in Belgium, corresponding to 12.9% of the total population.
At the beginning of 2012, people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed around 25% of the total population i.e.
Of these new Belgians, 1,200,000 are of European ancestry and 1,350,000 are from non-Western countries (most of them from Morocco, Turkey, and the DR Congo).
Since the modification of the Belgian nationality law in 1984 more than 1.3 million migrants have acquired Belgian citizenship.
The largest group of immigrants and their descendants in Belgium are Moroccans, with more than 450,000 people.
The Turks are the third largest group, and the second largest Muslim ethnic group, numbering 220,000.
89.2% of inhabitants of Turkish origin have been naturalized, as have 88.4% of people of Moroccan background, 75.4% of Italians, 56.2% of the French and 47.8% of Dutch people.
===Languages===Belgium has three official languages, which are (in order of size of the native speaking population of Belgium) Dutch, French and German.
A number of non-official minority languages are spoken as well.
As no census exists, there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of Belgium's three official languages or their dialects.
An estimated 60% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often referred to as Flemish), and 40% of the population speaks French.
Roughly 23,000 more German speakers live in municipalities near the official Community.
According to 2012 estimates, the average life expectancy is 79.65 years.
Death in Belgium is mainly due to heart and vascular disorders, neoplasms, disorders of the respiratory system and unnatural causes of death (accidents, suicide).
Non-natural causes of death and cancer are the most common causes of death for females up to age 24 and males up to age 44.
==Culture==Despite its political and linguistic divisions, the region corresponding to today's Belgium has seen the flourishing of major artistic movements that have had tremendous influence on European art and culture.
Nowadays, to a certain extent, cultural life is concentrated within each language Community, and a variety of barriers have made a shared cultural sphere less pronounced.
Since the 1970s, there are no bilingual universities or colleges in the country except the Royal Military Academy and the Antwerp Maritime Academy, no common media and no single large cultural or scientific organisation in which both main communities are represented.
The Mosan art, the Early Netherlandish, the Flemish Renaissance and Baroque painting and major examples of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architecture are milestones in the history of art.
Though the Baroque style of Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck flourished in the early 17th century in the Southern Netherlands, it gradually declined thereafter.

Latvia (; , officially the Republic of Latvia (), is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe, one of the three Baltic states.
The Republic of Latvia was founded on 18 November 1918.
In the beginning of the 13th century, large parts of today's Latvia were ruled by Germans.
Together with Southern Estonia, these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as Terra Mariana or Livonia.
Latgalia, the easternmost region of Latvia, became a part of the Polish district of Inflanty.
The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia became an autonomous Russian province (the Courland Governorate) in 1795, bringing all of what is now Latvia into the Russian Empire.
The Young Latvian () movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order.
Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian Revolution, which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces.
The War of Independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in Eastern Europe.
Eastern Latvia was cleared of Red Army forces by Latvian and Polish troops in early 1920 (from the Polish perspective the Battle of Daugavpils was a part of the Polish-Soviet War).
With most of Latvia's industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915, radical land reform was the central political question for the young state.
In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%.
By 1923, the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level.
Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy, but it soon suffered from the effects of the Great Depression.
The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet "spheres of influence".
In the North, Latvia, Finland and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere.
Thereafter, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded their respective portions of Poland.
In total 50,000 Baltic Germans left by the deadline of December 1939, with 1,600 remaining to conclude business and 13,000 choosing to remain in Latvia.
Most of those who remained left for Germany in summer 1940, when a second resettlement scheme was agreed.
The Soviet Union incorporated Latvia on 5 August 1940, as The "Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic.
Under German occupation, Latvia was administered as part of "Reichskommissariat Ostland".
In 1944, part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control.
The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system.
After the German surrender, it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay, and Latvian national partisans, soon joined by German collaborators, began to fight against the new occupier.
Most sources count 200,000 to 250,000 refugees leaving Latvia, with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the Soviets or, during few months immediately after the end of war, returned by the West.
In the post-war period, Latvia was made to adopt Soviet farming methods.
All of the minority schools (Jewish, Polish, Belorussian, Estonian, Lithuanian) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools: Latvian and Russian.
To maintain and expand industrial production, skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union, decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic.
In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the Popular Front of Latvia, was opposed by the Interfront.
Pro-independence Popular Front of Latvia candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the Supreme Council in the March 1990 democratic elections.
However, the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991.
In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions.
During the transitional period, Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia.
In spite of this, 73% of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 March 1991, in a nonbinding advisory referendum.
Still, today there are 290,660 non-citizens in Latvia, which represent 14.1% of population.
They have no citizenship of any country, and cannot vote in Latvia.
The Republic of Latvia declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on 21 August 1991, in the aftermath of the failed Soviet coup attempt.
The major goals of Latvia in the 1990s, to join NATO and the European Union, were achieved in 2004.

==Geography==Latvia lies in Northern Europe, on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea and northwestern part of the East European craton, between latitudes 55° and 58° N (a small area is north of 58°), and longitudes 21° and 29° E (a small area is west of 21°).
Latvia has the 5th highest proportion of land covered by forests in the European Union, after Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Slovenia.
Major rivers include the Daugava River, Lielupe, Gauja, Venta, and Salaca, the largest spawning ground for salmon in the eastern Baltics.
Mires occupy 9.9% of Latvia's territory.
Of these, 42% are raised bogs; 49% are fens; and 9% are transitional mires.

Several species of flora and fauna are considered national symbols.
Oak ("Quercus robur", ), and linden ("Tilia cordata", ) are Latvia's national trees and the daisy ("Leucanthemum vulgare", ) its national flower.
The white wagtail ("Motacilla alba", ) is Latvia's national bird.

Many historians trace the establishment of a Polish state to 966, when Mieszko I, ruler of a territory roughly coextensive with that of present-day Poland, converted to Christianity.
Poland regained its independence (as the Second Polish Republic) at the end of World War I, in 1918.
Two decades later, in September 1939, World War II started with the invasions of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (as part of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact).
More than six million Polish citizens died in the war.
Despite the vast destruction the country experienced during World War II, Poland managed to preserve much of its cultural wealth.
There are 14 heritage sites inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage and 54 Historical Monuments and many objects of cultural heritage.
With origins in the culture of the Proto-Slavs, over time Polish culture has been profoundly influenced by its interweaving ties with the Germanic, Latinate and Byzantine worlds as well as in continual dialog with the many other ethnic groups and minorities living in Poland.
The people of Poland have traditionally been seen as hospitable to artists from abroad and eager to follow cultural and artistic trends popular in other countries.
These factors have contributed to the versatile nature of Polish art, with all its complex nuances.
Great Polish painter Jan Matejko devoted his monumental art to the most significant historical events on Polish lands, along with the playwright, painter and poet Stanisław Wyspiański.

Prior to World War II, ethnic minorities made up a significant proportion of the Polish population.
Poland has maintained a high level of gender equality, an established disability rights movement and promotes peaceful equality.
Poland has, throughout most of its long history, experienced only very limited immigration from abroad; this trend can be largely attributed to Poland's rejection of slavery and to a lack of overseas colonies as well as occupation of its territories during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Despite this, the country has for a long time been regarded as having a very tolerant society, which affords equal rights to all people no matter what their ethnic background.
The history of Jews in Poland exemplifies peaceful co-existence of a nation with a particular ethnic group.
Today, as many as 96.7% of Polish citizens declare to be Poles, and 97.8% declare that they speak Polish at home (Census 2002).
The population of Poland became one of the most ethnically homogeneous in the world as a result of the radically altered borders after World War II and the subsequent migrations.
This homogeneity is a result of post World War II deportations ordered by the Soviet authorities, who wished to remove the sizeable Polish minorities from Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine and repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union (see territorial changes of Poland and historical demography of Poland for details).

Traditional Polish folk music has had a major effect on the works of many well-known Polish composers, and no more so than on Fryderyk Chopin, a widely recognised national hero of the arts.
It is largely thanks to him that the such pieces gained great popularity throughout Europe during the 19th century.
Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south, particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of Zakopane.

b Sources vary with regards to what was the largest resistance movement during World War II.
The confusion often stems from the fact that as war progressed, some resistance movements grew larger – and other diminished.
Certainly, Polish resistance was the largest resistance till German invasion of Yugoslavia and invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.
After that point, the numbers of Soviet partisans and Yugoslav partisans begun growing rapidly.
The numbers of Soviet partisans quickly caught up and were very similar to that of the Polish resistance.
The numbers of Tito's Yugoslav partisans were roughly similar to those of the Polish and Soviet partisans in the first years of the war (1941–1942), but grew rapidly in the latter years, outnumbering the Polish and Soviet partisans by 2:1 or more (estimates give Yugoslavian forces about 800,000 in 1945, to Polish and Soviet forces of 400,000 in 1944).
Lithuania (; ; ), officially the Republic of Lithuania (), is a country in Northern Europe, one of the three Baltic states.
==Etymology==The etymology of the word Denmark, and especially the relationship between Danes and Denmark and the unifying of Denmark as a single kingdom, is a subject which attracts debate.
This is centred primarily on the prefix "Dan" and whether it refers to the Dani or a historical person Dan and the exact meaning of the -"mark" ending.
The issue is further complicated by a number of references to various Dani people in Scandinavia or other places in Europe in Greek and Roman accounts (like Ptolemy, Jordanes, and Gregory of Tours), as well as mediaeval literature (like Adam of Bremen, Beowulf, Widsith, and Poetic Edda).
The Roman provinces maintained trade routes and relations with native tribes in Denmark, and Roman coins have been found in Denmark.
Evidence of strong Celtic cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of North-West Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the Gundestrup cauldron.
A new runic alphabet was first used around the same time and Ribe, the oldest town of Denmark, was founded about AD 700.
Thus, much of the next 125 years of Scandinavian history revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly.
The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as Swedish King Gustav Vasa conquered the city of Stockholm.
The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in both 1801 and 1807, in one case carrying off the Danish fleet, in the other, burning large parts of Copenhagen.

The Old Swiss Confederacy had acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars, but expansion of the federation suffered a setback in 1515 with the Swiss defeat in the Battle of Marignano.
The success of Zwingli's Reformation in some cantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 (Wars of Kappel).
It was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that, in 1648, under the Peace of Westphalia, European countries recognized Switzerland's independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its neutrality.
During the Early Modern period of Swiss history, the growing authoritarianism of the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the Thirty Years' War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653.
In the background to this struggle, the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the Battles of Villmergen in 1656 and 1712.
Switzerland lies between latitudes 45° and 48° N, and longitudes 5° and 11° E. It contains three basic topographical areas: the Swiss Alps to the south, the Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau, and the Jura mountains on the west.
The Alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country, comprising about 60% of the country's total area.
Switzerland has more than 1500 lakes, and contains 6% of Europe's stock of fresh water.
The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing.
Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations and it was the first state to join it by referendum.

The second one was decided in response to the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.
The third mobilisation of the army took place in September 1939 in response to the German attack on Poland; Henri Guisan was elected as the General-in-Chief.
Because of its neutrality policy, the Swiss army does not currently take part in armed conflicts in other countries, but is part of some peacekeeping missions around the world.
Following the end of the Cold War there have been a number of attempts to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether.
A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989.

The western French-speaking areas and the urban regions of the rest of the country tend to be more pro-EU, however with far from any significant share of the population.
These agreements were signed in 1999 and took effect in 2001.
They continue to discuss further areas for cooperation.
In 2006, Switzerland approved 1000 million francs of supportive investment in the poorer Southern and Central European countries in support of cooperation and positive ties to the EU as a whole.

The agency is supporting the 2000-watt society initiative to cut the nation's energy use by more than half by the year 2050.
On 25 May 2011 the Swiss government announced that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades.
"The government has voted for a phaseout because we want to ensure a secure and autonomous supply of energy", Energy Minister Doris Leuthard said that day at a press conference in Bern.
"Fukushima showed that the risk of nuclear power is too high, which in turn has also increased the costs of this energy form.

===Urbanization===Between two thirds and three quarters of the population live in urban areas.
Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years.
Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years.
This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use.
However from the beginning of the 21st century, the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside.
Switzerland has a dense network of cities, where large, medium and small cities are complementary.
The plateau is very densely populated with about 450 people per km2 and the landscape continually shows signs of man's presence.
In international comparison the importance of these urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests.
Geneva converted to Protestantism in 1536, just before John Calvin arrived there.

A 1980 initiative calling for the complete separation of church and state was rejected by 78.9% of the voters.
==Culture==Three of Europe's major languages are official in Switzerland.
In the 18th century, French became the fashionable language in Bern and elsewhere, while the influence of the French-speaking allies and subject lands was more marked than before.
Probably the most famous Swiss literary creation, "Heidi", the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Alps, is one of the most popular children's books ever and has come to be a symbol of Switzerland.
The latter town hosted the second Winter Olympic Games in 1928 and the fifth edition in 1948.
Many Swiss also follow ice hockey and support one of the 12 clubs in the League A, which is the most attended league in Europe.
In 2009, Switzerland hosted the IIHF World Championship for the 10th time.

Chocolate had been made in Switzerland since the 18th century but it gained its reputation at the end of the 19th century with the invention of modern techniques such as conching and tempering which enabled its production on a high quality level.
Also a breakthrough was the invention of solid milk chocolate in 1875 by Daniel Peter.
The most popular alcoholic drink in Switzerland is wine.
Switzerland is notable for the variety of grapes grown because of the large variations in terroirs, with their specific mixes of soil, air, altitude and light.
Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland since the Roman era, even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin.
San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe.
Legend has it that Marinus left Rab, then the Roman colony of Arba, in 257 when the future emperor, Diocletian, issued a decree calling for the reconstruction of the city walls of Rimini, which had been destroyed by Liburnian pirates.
The country's economy mainly relies on finance, industry, services and tourism.
It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP (per capita), with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions.
San Marino is considered to have a highly stable economy, with one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, no national debt and a budget surplus.

With an area of , Spain is the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union, and the fourth largest country in Europe.
Modern humans first arrived in Iberia, from the north on foot, about 35,000 years ago.
It took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, though they had control of it for over six centuries.
The Suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern Galicia and northern Portugal.
As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity.
These conquests were part of the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate.
Only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion.
Muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the Middle East and North Africa.
Muslim and Jewish scholars played an important part in reviving and expanding classical Greek learning in Western Europe.
The 13th century also witnessed the Crown of Aragon, centred in Spain's north east, expand its reach across islands in the Mediterranean, to Sicily and even Athens.
Around this time the universities of Palencia (1212/1263) and Salamanca (1218/1254) were established.
The Black Death of 1348 and 1349 devastated Spain.
That same year, Spain's Jews were ordered to convert to Catholicism or face expulsion from Spanish territories during the Spanish Inquisition.
This period saw the Italian Wars, the Revolt of the Comuneros, the Dutch Revolt, the Morisco Revolt, clashes with the Ottomans, the Anglo-Spanish War and wars with France.
The result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean.
Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire, and help the imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces, but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of Portugal (with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640) and the Netherlands, and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive, Europe-wide Thirty Years' War.
Enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy.
Military assistance for the rebellious British colonies in the American War of Independence improved the kingdom's international standing.
The 2 May 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the Bonapartist regime.
A period of authoritarian rule under General Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1931) ended with the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic.
After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations.
This changed in 1955, during the Cold War period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin.
With Franco's death in November 1975, Juan Carlos succeeded to the position of King of Spain and head of state in accordance with the law.
With the approval of the new Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy, the State devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities.
The group was formed in 1959 during Franco's rule but has continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy.
On 23 February 1981, rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose a military backed government.

The PSOE was replaced in government by the Partido Popular (PP) after the latter won the 1996 General Elections; at that point the PSOE had served almost 14 consecutive years in office.
In contrast with the Mediterranean climate, the dry season extends beyond the summer.
As of November 2009, the government of Spain keeps a balanced gender equality ratio.
Nine out of the 18 members of the government are women.
The Spanish administration has also promoted gender-based positive discrimination by approving gender equality legislation in 2007 aimed at providing equality between genders in Spanish political and economic life (Gender Equality Act).
However, in the legislative branch, as of July 2010 only 128 of the 350 members of the Congress are women (36.3%).
In the Senate, the ratio is even lower, since there are only 79 women out of 263 (30.0%).
The Gender Empowerment Measure of Spain in the United Nations Human Development Report is 0.794, 12th in the world.
=== Foreign relations ===After the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975, Spain's foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the Franco years and expand diplomatic relations, enter the European Community, and define security relations with the West.
Even on many international issues beyond western Europe, Spain prefers to co-ordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political co-operation mechanisms.
It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002.
Unemployment stood at 7.6% in October 2006, a rate that compared favourably to many other European countries, and especially with the early 1990s when it stood at over 20%.
Perennial weak points of Spain's economy include high inflation, a large underground economy, and an education system which OECD reports place among the poorest for developed countries, together with the United States and UK.
In the last five decades, international tourism in Spain has grown to become the second largest in the world in terms of spending, worth approximately 40 billion Euros or about 5% of GDP in 2006.
In 2010 Spain became the solar power world leader when it overtook the United States with a massive power station plant called La Florida, near Alvarado, Badajoz.
Spain's population density, at 91/km² (235/sq mi), is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal.
Native Spaniards make up 88% of the total population of Spain.
After the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and Spain's population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward, based initially on the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population.
The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (4%).
In 2008, Spain granted citizenship to 84,170 persons, mostly to people from Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco.
A sizeable portion of foreign residents in Spain also comes from other Western and Central European countries.
Around 240,000 Spaniards emigrated in the 16th century, mostly to Peru and Mexico.
Another 450,000 left in the 17th century.
Between 1846 and 1932 it is estimated that nearly 5 million Spaniards emigrated to the Americas, especially to Argentina and Brazil.
Approximately two million Spaniards migrated to other Western European countries between 1960 and 1975.
During the same period perhaps 300,000 went to Latin America.
For some people, Spain's identity consists more of an overlap of different regional identities than of a sole Spanish identity.
Indeed, some of the regional identities may even conflict with the Spanish one.
Since 2000, Spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows, despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level.
The number of immigrants in Spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2 million in 2008 out of a total population of 46 million.
In 2005 alone, a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people.
=== Education ===State education in Spain is free and compulsory from the age of six to sixteen.
=== Religion ===Roman Catholicism has long been the main religion of Spain, and although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class, and Catholicism is the only religion officially taught.
Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services.
This same study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 59% hardly ever or never go to church, 15% go to church some times a year, 8% some time per month and 14% every Sunday or multiple times per week.
Altogether, about 22% of the entire Spanish population attends religious services at least once per month.
Though Spanish society has become considerably more secular in recent decades, the influx of Latin American immigrants, who tend to be strong Catholic practitioners, has helped the Catholic Church to recover.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has approximately 46,000 adherents in 133 congregations in all regions of the country and has a temple in the Moratalaz District of Madrid.
After the Reconquista in 1492, Muslims did not live in Spain for centuries.
Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population.

In north Spain, the game of pelota is very popular.
Each municipality is allowed to declare a maximum of 14 public holidays per year; up to nine of these are chosen by the national government and at least two are chosen locally.
== History ==Monaco's name comes from the 6th century BC nearby Phocaean Greek colony.
According to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods.
Because the only temple of this area was the "House" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos.
The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests, and resolved the Monaco Succession Crisis.
Chad ( '; ), officially the Republic of Chad, is a landlocked country in Central Africa.

While many political parties are active, power lies firmly in the hands of President Déby and his political party, the Patriotic Salvation Movement.
Chad is one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the world; most inhabitants live in poverty as subsistence herders and farmers.
Since 2003, crude oil has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional cotton industry.
== Demographics ==2005 estimates place Chad's population at 10,146,000; 25.8% live in urban areas and 74.8% in rural ones.
It belongs to the UN and its main specialized agencies and in 1980–81 served on the UN Security Council.
This has been especially true in the 20th century, with the most severe drought on record beginning in the late 1960s and lasting, with one break, well into the 1980s.
Niger also has the highest fertility rate in the world (7.03 births per woman according to 2013 estimates); this means that nearly half (49%) of the Nigerien population is under age 15.
Mali is the eighth largest country in Africa, with an area of just over .
In the late 19th century, during the Scramble for Africa, France seized control of Mali, making it a part of French Sudan.
After a long period of one-party rule, a 1991 coup led to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of Mali as a democratic, multi-party state.

The APRC maintained its strong majority in the National Assembly in legislative elections held in January 2002, particularly after the main opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) boycotted the legislative elections.
Jammeh won the 2006 election handily after the opposition coalition, the National Alliance for Democracy and Development, splintered earlier in the year.
The voting was generally regarded as free and fair, though events from the run-up raised criticism from some.
A journalist from the state television station assigned to the chief opposition candidate, Ousainou Darboe, was arrested.
Additionally, Jammeh said, "I will develop the areas that vote for me, but if you don't vote for me, don't expect anything".
On 21 and 22 March 2006, amid tensions preceding the 2006 presidential elections, an alleged planned military coup was uncovered.
President Yahya Jammeh immediately returned from a trip to Mauritania, many army officials were arrested, and prominent army officials fled the country.
The 1970 constitution, which divided the government into independent executive, legislative, and judicial branches, was suspended after the 1994 military coup.
As part of the transition process, the AFPRC established the Constitution Review Commission (CRC) through decree in March 1995.
In accordance with the timetable for the transition to a democratically elected government, the commission drafted a new constitution for the Gambia, which was approved by referendum in August 1996.
The constitution provides for a strong presidential government, a unicameral legislature, an independent judiciary, and the protection of human rights.
The Gambia plays an active role in international affairs, especially West African and Islamic affairs, although its representation abroad is limited.
Prior to the 1994 coup, the Gambian Armed Forces received technical assistance and training from the United States, United Kingdom, People's Republic of China, Nigeria, and Turkey.
With the withdrawal of most of this aid, the Army has received renewed assistance from Turkey and others.
The government also did not establish a state religion.
The Christian community represents about eight percent of the population.
(It also made it strategic to the halt of this trade once it was outlawed in the 19th century.
Guinea , officially the Republic of Guinea (), is a country in West Africa.
Liberia was a founding member of League of Nations, United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity.
A peace agreement in 2003 led to democratic elections in 2005.
These new inhabitants brought skills such as cotton spinning, cloth weaving, iron smelting, rice and sorghum cultivation, and social and political institutions from the Mali and Songhai Empires.
People along the coast built canoes and traded with other West Africans from Cap-Vert to the Gold Coast.
Between 1461 and late 17th century, Portuguese, Dutch and British traders had contacts and trading posts in the region.
European traders would barter various commodities and goods with local people.
When the Kru began trading with Europeans, they initially traded in commodities, but later they actively participated in the African slave trade.
Similar organizations established colonies in Mississippi-in-Africa and the Republic of Maryland, which were later annexed by Liberia.
The leadership of the new nation consisted largely of the Americo-Liberians.

The National Patriotic Front of Liberia, a rebel group led by Charles Taylor, launched an insurrection in December 1989 against Doe's government with the backing of neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso and Côte d'Ivoire, triggering the First Liberian Civil War.
By September 1990, Doe's forces controlled only a small area just outside the capital, and Doe was captured and executed that month by rebel forces.
From 1989 to 1996 one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars ensued, claiming the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and displacing a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries.
A peace deal between warring parties was reached in 1995 leading to Taylor's election as president in 1997.
Under Taylor's leadership, Liberia became internationally known as a pariah state due to the use of blood diamonds and illegal timber exports to fund the Revolutionary United Front in the Sierra Leone Civil War.
The Second Liberian Civil War began in 1999 when Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, a rebel group based in the northwest of the country, launched an armed insurrection against Taylor.
=== 2000s ===In March 2003, a second rebel group, Movement for Democracy in Liberia, began launching attacks against Taylor from the southeast.
Peace talks between the factions began in Accra in June of that year, and Taylor was indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for crimes against humanity that same month.

Liberia is one of the world's poorest countries, with a formal employment rate of 15%.
Historically, the Liberian economy has depended heavily on foreign aid, foreign direct investment and exports of natural resources such as iron ore, rubber and timber.
Following a peak in growth in 1979, the Liberian economy began a steady decline due to economic mismanagement following the 1980 coup.
This decline was accelerated by the outbreak of civil war in 1989; GDP was reduced by an estimated 90% between 1989 and 1995, one of the fastest declines in history.
Upon the end of the war in 2003, GDP growth began to accelerate, reaching 9.4% in 2007.
The global financial crisis slowed GDP growth to 4.6% in 2009, though a strengthening agricultural sector led by rubber and timber exports increased growth to 5.1% in 2010 and an expected 7.3% in 2011, making the economy one of the 20 fastest growing in the world.
Current impediments to growth include a small domestic market, lack of adequate infrastructure, high transportation costs, poor trade links with neighboring countries and the high dollarization of the economy.
Liberia used the United States dollar as its currency from 1943 until 1982 and continues to use the U.S. dollar alongside the Liberian dollar.
Following a decrease in inflation beginning in 2003, inflation spiked in 2008 as a result of worldwide food and energy crises, reaching 17.5% before declining to 7.4% in 2009.

Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war.
The major political parties at present include the ruling People's Democratic Party of Nigeria, which maintains 223 seats in the House and 76 in the Senate (61.9% and 69.7% respectively); the opposition All Nigeria People's Party has 96 House seats and 27 in the Senate (26.6% and 24.7%).
About twenty minor opposition parties are registered.
In a national television address in 2007, he added that if Nigerians did not like the victory of his handpicked successor, they would have an opportunity to vote again in four years.
As in many other African societies, prebendalism and high rates of corruption continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria.
In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote rigging.
It is an Islamic legal system that had been used long before the colonial administration.
=== Foreign relations ===Upon gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria made African unity the centrepiece of its foreign policy and played a leading role in the fight against the apartheid government in South Africa.
One notable exception to the African focus was Nigeria's close relationship developed with Israel throughout the 1960s.
Nigeria's foreign policy was tested in the 1970s after the country emerged united from its own civil war.
It supported movements against white minority governments in the Southern Africa sub-region.
Nigeria backed the African National Congress (ANC) by taking a committed tough line with regard to the South African government and their military actions in southern Africa.
Nigeria was also a founding member of the Organisation for African Unity (now the African Union), and has tremendous influence in West Africa and Africa on the whole.
With this African-centred stance, Nigeria readily sent troops to the Congo at the behest of the United Nations shortly after independence (and has maintained membership since that time).
Nigeria also supported several Pan African and pro-self government causes in the 1970s, including garnering support for Angola's MPLA, SWAPO in Namibia, and aiding opposition to the minority governments of Portuguese Mozambique, and Rhodesia.
Nigeria is also a member of the International Criminal Court, and the Commonwealth of Nations.
Nigeria has remained a key player in the international oil industry since the 1970s, and maintains membership in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which it joined in July 1971.
Its status as a major petroleum producer figures prominently in its sometimes volatile international relations with both developed countries, notably the United States, and the developing countries of China, Jamaica, and Ghana and Kenya in Africa.
Millions of Nigerians have emigrated at times of economic hardship, primarily to Europe, North America and Australia.
It is estimated that over a million Nigerians have emigrated to the United States and constitute the Nigerian American populace.
Individuals in many such Diasporic communities have joined the "Egbe Omo Yoruba" society, a national association of Yoruba descendants in North America.
The price of khat, imported daily from Kenya, was also five U.S. dollars per standard bunch.
==Culture==The culture of Kenya consists of multiple traditions.
It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and the Indian Ocean to the east.
During this time, Zanzibar became the centre for the Arab slave trade.
A campaign to register new members was launched, and within a year TANU had become the leading political organisation in the country.
Nyerere became Minister of British-administered Tanganyika in 1960 and continued as prime minister when Tanganyika became independent in 1961.
After the declaration, banks and many large industries were nationalised.
Located on the equator, Gabon is bordered by Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, Cameroon to the north, the Republic of the Congo on the east and south, and the Gulf of Guinea to the west.
In 1910 Gabon became one of the four territories of French Equatorial Africa, a federation that survived until 1959.
These territories became independent on August 17, 1960.
The coastal plains form a large section of the World Wildlife Fund's Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests ecoregion and contain patches of Central African mangroves especially on the Muni River estuary on the border with Equatorial Guinea.
Gabon has three karst areas where there are hundreds of caves located in the dolomite and limestone rocks.
Natural resources include: petroleum, magnesium, iron, gold, uranium, and forests.
In the Zambezi basin, there are a number of major rivers flowing wholly or partially through Zambia: the Kabompo, Lungwebungu, Kafue, Luangwa, and the Zambezi itself, which flows through the country in the west and then forms its southern border with Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe.
Its source is in Zambia but it diverts into Angola, and a number of its tributaries rise in Angola's central highlands.
The Zambezi valley, running along the southern border, is both deep and wide.
The Luangwa Valley splits the plateau in a curve north east to south west, extended west into the heart of the plateau by the deep valley of the Lunsemfwa River.
Their culminating peak Mumpu is at the western end and at is the highest point in Zambia away from the eastern border region.
Mozambique ( or ), officially the Republic of Mozambique ( or "", ), is a country in Southeast Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest.
The only official language of Mozambique is Portuguese, which is spoken mostly as a second language by about half of the population.
The largest religion in Mozambique is Christianity, with significant minorities following Islam and African traditional religions.
There are around 350 species of mammals that can be found in Zimbabwe.
There are also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species.
An association of doctors in Zimbabwe has made calls for President Mugabe to make moves to assist the ailing health service.
Some 85% of Zimbabweans are Christian; 62% of the population attends religious services regularly.
English is spoken primarily in the cities, but less so in rural areas.
== Health ==At independence, the policies of racial inequality were reflected in the disease patterns of the black majority.
The first five years after independence saw rapid gains in areas such as immunisation coverage, access to health care, and contraceptive prevalence rate.
The country suffered occasional outbreaks of acute diseases (such as plague in 1994).
The gains on the national health were eroded by structural adjustment in the 1990s, the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the economic crisis since the year 2000.
By the end of November 2008, three of Zimbabwe's four major hospitals had shut down, along with the Zimbabwe Medical School, and the fourth major hospital had two wards and no operating theatres working.
The ongoing political and economic crisis also contributed to the emigration of the doctors and people with medical knowledge.
On 4 December 2008 the Zimbabwe government declared the outbreak to be a national emergency and asked for international aid.
By 9 March 2009 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 4,011 people had succumbed to the waterborne disease since the outbreak began in August 2008, and the total number of cases recorded had reached 89,018.
In Harare, the city council offered free graves to cholera victims.
In June 2011, the United Nations Population Fund released a report on The State of the World's Midwifery.
It contained new data on the midwifery workforce and policies relating to newborn and maternal mortality for 58 countries.
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Zimbabwe is 790.
The education department has stated that 20,000 teachers have left Zimbabwe since 2007 and that half of Zimbabwe's children have not progressed beyond primary school.
School education was made free in 1980, but since 1988, the government has steadily increased the charges attached to school enrolment until they now greatly exceed the real value of fees in 1980.
The academic year in Zimbabwe runs from January to December, with three terms, broken up by one month holidays, with a total of 40 weeks of school per year.
There are seven public universities as well as four church-related universities in Zimbabwe that are fully internationally accredited.
The University of Zimbabwe, the first and largest, was built in 1952 and is located in the Harare suburb of Mount Pleasant.
Education in Zimbabwe became under threat since the economic changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike because of low pay, students unable to concentrate because of hunger and the price of uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury.

These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war: Italy, Japan and the United States joined the Allies, and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers.
Ultimately, more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.
Meanwhile, on the Eastern Front, the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians, but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans.
These had started in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria.
With the launch of in 1906, the British Empire expanded on its significant advantage over its German rival.
The arms race between Britain and Germany eventually extended to the rest of Europe, with all the major powers devoting their industrial base to producing the equipment and weapons necessary for a pan-European conflict.
Between 1908 and 1913, the military spending of the European powers increased by 50%.
Germany attacked Luxembourg on 2 August and on 3 August declared war on France.
On 4 August, after Belgium refused to permit German troops to cross its borders into France, Germany declared war on Belgium as well.
The plan called for the right flank of the German advance to bypass the French armies (which were concentrated on the Franco-German border, leaving the Belgian border without significant French forces) and move south to Paris.
Initially the Germans were successful, particularly in the Battle of the Frontiers (14–24 August).
By 12 September, the French, with assistance from the British forces, halted the German advance east of Paris at the First Battle of the Marne (5–12 September), and pushed the German forces back some .
The last days of this battle signified the end of mobile warfare in the west.
In response, Germany rapidly moved the 8th Field Army, from its previous role as reserve for the invasion of France, to East Prussia by rail across the German Empire.
While the Russian invasion failed, it caused the diversion of German troops to the east, allowing the tactical Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.
====Asia and the Pacific====New Zealand occupied German Samoa (later Western Samoa) on 30 August 1914.
The German colonial forces in German East Africa, led by Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, fought a guerrilla warfare campaign during World War I and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe.
The Indian Army in fact outnumbered the British Army at the beginning of the war; about 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while the central government and the princely states sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition.
In all, 140,000 men served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East.
Casualties of Indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during World War I.
On 22 April 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans (violating the Hague Convention) used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front.
German U-boats attempted to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain.
Finally, in early 1917, Germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, realising that the Americans would eventually enter the war.
A Serbian counterattack in the Battle of Kolubara, however, succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914.
Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the Central Powers, now including Bulgaria, sent in 600,000 troops.
The Serbs suffered defeat in the Battle of Kosovo.
In Mesopotamia, by contrast, after the disastrous Siege of Kut (1915–16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured Baghdad in March 1917.
Russian armies generally had the best of it in the Caucasus.
In December 1914 the Ottoman Empire, with German support, invaded Persia (modern Iran) in an effort to cut off British and Russian access to petroleum reservoirs around Baku near the Caspian Sea.
General Yudenich, the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories.
Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its alliance.
The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of Tunisia in return.
On 1 November, the Italian Navy destroyed much of the Austro-Hungarian fleet stationed in Pula, preventing it from being handed over to the new State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.
As a result of the Battle of Bucharest, the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916.
The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918.
Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.
On 5 August, they captured Warsaw and forced the Russians to withdraw from Poland.
Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia, as the Tsar remained at the front.
At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when German troops began marching across the Ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918.
The Legion in Russia was established in 1917, in December 1917 in France (including volunteers from America) and in April 1918 in Italy.
In Russia, they were heavily involved in the Russian Civil War fighting the Bolsheviks, at times controlling most of the Trans-Siberian railway and conquering all major cities in Siberia.
The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany.
Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell and the United States troops joined the war in large numbers far earlier than Germany had anticipated.
Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.
====Ottoman Empire conflict, 1917–1918====In March and April 1917, at the First and Second Battles of Gaza, German and Ottoman forces stopped the advance of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, which had begun in August 1916 at Romani.
During several months of reorganisation and training during the summer, a number of attacks were carried out on sections of the Ottoman front line.
It was not until the middle of September that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.
Wilson called on antiwar elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe.
He argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference.
The United States had a small army, but, after the passage of the Selective Service Act, it drafted 2.8 million men, and, by summer 1918, was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day.
The operation commenced on 21 March 1918, with an attack on British forces near Amiens.
This German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.
By 20 July, the Germans had retreated across the Marne to their starting lines, having achieved little, and the German Army never regained the initiative.
====New states under war zone====In the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the South Caucasus: the First Republic of Armenia, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which declared their independence from the Russian Empire.
Solidarity was briefly maintained when the Transcaucasian Federative Republic was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians asked and received protection from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance.
After an advance as far as , German resistance stiffened, and the battle was concluded on 12 August.
In nearly four weeks of fighting beginning 8 August, over 100,000 German prisoners were taken, 75,000 by the BEF and the rest by the French.
On 8 October the line was pierced again by British and Dominion troops at the Battle of Cambrai.
Meanwhile, news of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces.
The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food.
Its reserves had been used up, even as US troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day.
Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French.
During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb.
On 3 November, Austria-Hungary sent a flag of truce to ask for an armistice.
On 11 November, at 5:00 am, an armistice with Germany was signed in a railroad carriage at Compiègne.
Among the Allies, the UK spent $21 billion and the US $17 billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20 billion.
===Peace treaties and national boundaries===After the war, the Paris Peace Conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war.
The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the October Revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland were carved from it.
When Britain declared war in 1914, the dominions were automatically at war; at the conclusion, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa were individual signatories of the Treaty of Versailles.
Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5%.
By 1922, there were between 4.5 million and 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920–1922.
Thousands more emigrated to France, England, and the United States.
Diseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions.
In 1914 alone, louse-borne epidemic typhus killed 200,000 in Serbia.
From 1918 to 1922, Russia had about 25 million infections and 3 million deaths from epidemic typhus.
By 1914, their military utility was obvious.
They were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack.
The shooting was reported to the media by American citizens who were on board the "Nicosia", a British freighter loaded with war supplies, which was stopped by U-27 just minutes before the incident.
It is estimated that the use of chemical weapons employed by both sides throughout the war had inflicted 1.3 million casualties.
Many commanders on both sides knew that such weapons would cause major harm to civilians as wind would blow poison gases into nearby civilian towns but nonetheless continued to use them throughout the war.
Germany held 2.5 million prisoners; Russia held 2.2–2.9 million; while Britain and France held about 720,000.
Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the International Red Cross and inspections by neutral nations.
However, conditions were terrible in Russia: starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15–20% of the prisoners in Russia died (in some researches it is stated that 2.5% of prisoners in Russia died), and in Central Powers imprisonment—8% of Russians.
In Germany, food was scarce, but only 5% died.
German prisoners were still being held in Russia as late as 1924.
The Yugoslav Committee was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London; Trumbić led the Committee.
In the Middle East, Arab nationalism soared in Ottoman territories in response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war, with Arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a pan-Arab state.
A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914.
The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had resurfaced in 1912 and, by July 1914, there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland.
In Britain, 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status.
The Central Asian Revolt started in the summer of 1916, when the Russian Empire government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service.
In Milan, in May 1917, Bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.
The Italian army was forced to enter Milan with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and anarchists, who fought violently until 23 May when the army gained control of the city.
It opened a political gap between French Canadians, who believed their true loyalty should be to Canada and not to the British Empire, and members of the Anglophone majority, who saw the war as a duty to both Britain and Canada.
Around 625,000 Canadians served in World War I, of which 60,000 were killed and 173,000 wounded.
Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.
The experiences of the war led to a collective trauma shared by many from all participating countries.
To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily on Wall Street.
President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in US government lending to the Allies.
This circular system collapsed in 1931 and the loans were never repaid.
" Thus, following the Second World War, at the London Conference in 1953, Germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed.
On 3 October 2010, Germany made the final payment on these bonds.
1922) comprises the 11th edition plus three new volumes 30-31-32 that cover events since 1911 with thorough coverage of the war as well as every country and colony.

The first phase of the Cold War began in the first two years after the end of the Second World War in 1945.
The USSR consolidated its control over the states of the Eastern Bloc while the United States began a strategy of global containment to challenge Soviet power, extending military and financial aid to the countries of Western Europe (for example, supporting the anti-Communist side in the Greek Civil War) and creating the NATO alliance.
The Berlin Blockade (1948–49) was the first major crisis of the Cold War.
With victory of the Communist side in the Chinese Civil War and the outbreak of the Korean War (1950–53), the conflict expanded.
The USSR and USA competed for influence in Latin America and decolonizing states of Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
Meanwhile the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was stopped by the Soviets.
1985) and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan.
The result in 1989 was a wave of revolutions that peacefully (with the exception of the Romanian Revolution) overthrew all of the Communist regimes of Central and Eastern Europe.
Soviet agents took control of the media, especially radio; they quickly harassed and then banned all independent civic institutions, from youth groups to schools, churches and rival political parties.
Stalin also sought continued peace with Britain and the United States, hoping to focus on internal reconstruction and economic growth.
In the American view, Stalin seemed a potential ally in accomplishing their goals, whereas in the British approach Stalin appeared as the greatest threat to the fulfillment of their agenda.
With the Soviets already occupying most of Central and Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage and the two western leaders vied for his favors.
The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets.
In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and agreed to divide the Balkans into respective spheres of influence, and at Yalta Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin in regard of Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and the Reparations.
Following the Allies' May 1945 victory, the Soviets effectively occupied Central and Eastern Europe, while strong US and Western allied forces remained in Western Europe.
The Soviet-style regimes that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced Soviet command economies, but also adopted the brutal methods employed by Joseph Stalin and Soviet secret police to suppress real and potential opposition.
In February 1947, the British government announced that it could no longer afford to finance the Greek monarchical military regime in its civil war against communist-led insurgents ("see Greek Civil War").
The American government's response to this announcement was the adoption of containment, the goal of which was to stop the spread of communism.
In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union.
The plan's aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to Europe's balance of power, such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections.
The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery.
One month later, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, creating a unified Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council (NSC).
These would become the main bureaucracies for US policy in the Cold War.
Stalin believed that economic integration with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control, and that the US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe.
Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid.
The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, became known as the Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Comecon).
Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.
The twin policies of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and military aid for Western Europe, Greece, and Turkey.
With US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war.
At the same time there was increased intelligence and espionage activity, Eastern Bloc defections and diplomatic expulsions.
As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system.
Shortly thereafter, Stalin instituted the Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949), one of the first major crises of the Cold War, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in West Berlin.
The United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began the massive "Berlin airlift", supplying West Berlin with food and other provisions.
The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the policy change.
In May 1949, Stalin backed down and lifted the blockade.
Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948, the US, Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of West Germany from the three Western zones of occupation in April 1949.
The Soviet Union proclaimed its zone of occupation in Germany the German Democratic Republic that October.
Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, an alternative to the controlled and party-dominated domestic press.
Radio Free Europe was a product of some of the most prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F. Kennan.
In the early 1950s, the US worked for the rearmament of West Germany and, in 1955, secured its full membership of NATO.
In May 1953, Beria, by then in a government post, had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germany's incorporation into NATO.
According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China.
Moreover, his party was weakened in the war against Japanese.
Meanwhile the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese nationalism.
In NSC-68, a secret 1950 document, the National Security Council proposed to reinforce pro-Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense.
In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the "Pactomania"), the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines (notably ANZUS in 1951 and SEATO in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases.
To Stalin's surprise, the UN Security Council backed the defense of South Korea, though the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest that Taiwan and not Communist China held a permanent seat on the Council.
Even though the Chinese and North Koreans were exhausted by the war and were prepared to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death.
After Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea fell within a year under a period of military rule that lasted until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s.
As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared that the only way to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.
On 18 November 1956, while addressing Western ambassadors at a reception at the Polish embassy in Moscow, Khrushchev used his famous "Whether you like it or not, history is on our side.
He later claimed that he had not been talking about nuclear war, but rather about the historically determined victory of communism over capitalism.
Possessing nuclear superiority, for example, allowed Eisenhower to face down Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East during the 1956 Suez Crisis.
The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955.
The Soviet army invaded.
The field of AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956.
In 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off all undirected exploratory research in AI.
However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer lasting AI winter began.
The success was due to several factors: the increasing computational power of computers (see Moore's law), a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems, the creation of new ties between AI and other fields working on similar problems, and a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards.
These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display.
" For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies.
Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires.
AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.
Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge (e.g., Cyc) require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering—they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.
A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet, and thus be able to add to its own ontology.
Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge.
They need a way to visualize the future (they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it) and be able to make choices that maximize the utility (or "value") of the available choices.
Researchers disagree about many issues.
Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton University and the Ratio Club in England.
==== Symbolic ====When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation.
; Logic-based: Unlike Newell and Simon, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.
His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including knowledge representation, planning and learning.
Logic was also the focus of the work at the University of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of logic programming.
; Knowledge-based: When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications.
The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.
; Bottom-up, embodied, situated, behavior-based or nouvelle AI: Researchers from the related field of robotics, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.
These tools are truly scientific, in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AI's recent successes.
The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like mathematics, economics or operations research).
The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems.
The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach.
The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as decision theory and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents.
The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.
A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a hybrid intelligent system, and the study of such systems is artificial intelligence systems integration.
For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.
Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.
Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers.
The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.
==== Logic ====Logic is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well.
First-order logic also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other.
Fuzzy logic, is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0).
Fuzzy systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems.
Bayesian networks are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).
Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match.
They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI.
These examples are known as observations or patterns.
In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class.
A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made.
All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set.
Among recurrent networks, the most famous is the Hopfield net, a form of attractor network, which was first described by John Hopfield in 1982.
This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested.
However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.
Edward Fredkin argues that "artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's "Darwin among the Machines" (1863), and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.
1994.
The proposal was accepted in August 1942, when it was also decided that each month Palmach members would have eight training days, 14 work days and seven days off.
It is equal to 1,000 square meters.
Venezuela ( , ), officially called the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ( ), is a country on the northern coast of South America.
Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District (covering Caracas), and federal dependencies (covering Venezuela's offshore islands).
Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital, Caracas, which is also the largest city in Venezuela.
Since the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil.
The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, in which inflation peaked at 100% in 1996 and poverty rates rose to 66% in 1995 as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak.
Chávez also remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted from December 2002 to February 2003, including a strike/lockout in the state oil company PDVSA.
These devaluations have done little to improve the situation of the Venezuelan people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs while dollar-denominated oil sales account for the vast majority of Venezuela's exports.
Chávez survived several further political tests, including an August 2004 recall referendum.
He was elected for another term in December 2006 and re-elected for a third term in October 2012.
However, he was never sworn in for his third period, due to medical complications.
Chávez died on 5 March 2013 after a nearly two-year fight with cancer.
The presidential election that took place on Sunday, 14 April 2013, was the first since Chávez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot.
Nicolás Maduro has been the President of Venezuela since 14 April 2013, after winning the second presidential election after Chávez's death, with 50.61% of the votes against the opposition's candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski who had 49.12% of the votes.
Its cloud forests and lowland rainforests are particularly rich.
Venezuela hosts a total of 1,417 bird species, 48 of which are endemic.
Notable mammals include the giant anteater, jaguar, and the capybara, the world's largest rodent.
More than half of Venezuelan avian and mammalian species are found in the Amazonian forests south of the Orinoco.
For the fungi, an account was provided by R.W.G.
Dennis which has been digitized and the records made available on-line as part of the Cybertruffle Robigalia database.
That database includes nearly 3,900 species of fungi recorded from Venezuela, but is far from complete, and the true total number of fungal species already known from Venezuela is likely higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.
Among plants of Venezuela, over 25,000 species of orchids are found in the country's cloud forest and lowland rainforest ecosystems.
Venezuela is among the top 20 countries in terms of endemism.
The Central Range runs parallel to the coast and includes the hills surrounding Caracas; the Eastern Range, separated from the Central Range by the Gulf of Cariaco, covers all of Sucre and northern Monagas.
The Orinoco Delta, which forms a triangle covering Delta Amacuro, projects northeast into the Atlantic Ocean.
==Economy==The Central Bank of Venezuela is responsible for developing monetary policy for the Venezuelan bolívar which is used as currency.
The currency is primarily printed on paper and distributed throughout the country.
The President of the Central Bank of Venezuela is presently Eudomar Tovar, who also serves as the country's representative in the International Monetary Fund.
According to the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal, Venezuela has the weakest property rights in the world, scoring only 5.0 on a scale of 100; expropriation without compensation is not uncommon.
Venezuela has a Market-based mixed economy dominated by the petroleum sector, which accounts for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of exports, and more than half of government revenues.
Venezuela has the least expensive petrol in the world because the consumer price of petrol is heavily subsidized.
More than 60% of Venezuela's international reserves is in gold, eight times more than the average for the region.
Most of Venezuela's gold held abroad is located in London.
On 25 November 2011, the first of US$11 billion of repatriated gold bullion arrived in Caracas; Chávez called the repatriation of gold a "sovereign" step that will help protect the country's foreign reserves from the turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.
However government policies quickly spent down this returned gold and in 2013 the government was forced to add the dollar reserves of state owned companies to those of the national bank in order to reassure the international bond market.
Manufacturing contributed 17% of GDP in 2006.
Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela's land area.
The country is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture.
In 2012, total food consumption was over 26 million metric tonnes, a 94.8% increase from 2003.
Since the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil, and it is a founding member of OPEC.
The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996 and poverty rates rise to 66% in 1995 as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak.
The 1990s also saw Venezuela experience a major banking crisis in 1994.
The recovery of oil prices after 2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated social spending.
In 2003 the government of Hugo Chávez implemented currency controls after capital flight led to a devaluation of the currency.
This led to the development of a parallel market of dollars in the subsequent years with the official exchange rate less than a sixth of black market value.
The fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis saw a renewed economic downturn.
With social programs such as the Bolivarian Missions, Venezuela made progress in social development in 2000s, particularly in areas such as health, education, and poverty.
Many of the social policies pursued by Chávez and his administration were jumpstarted by the Millennium Development Goals, eight goals that Venezuela and 188 other nations agreed to in September 2000.
===Petroleum and other resources===Venezuela has the largest oil reserves, and the eighth largest natural gas reserves in the world, and consistently ranks among the top ten world crude oil producers.
Compared to the preceding year another 40.4% in crude oil reserves were proven in 2010, allowing Venezuela to surpass Saudi Arabia as the country with the largest reserves of this type.
The country's main petroleum deposits are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo, the Gulf of Venezuela (both in Zulia), and in the Orinoco River basin (eastern Venezuela), where the country's largest reserve is located.
Besides the largest conventional oil reserves and the second-largest natural gas reserves in the Western Hemisphere, Venezuela has non-conventional oil deposits (extra-heavy crude oil, bitumen and tar sands) approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil.
The electricity sector in Venezuela is one of the few to rely primarily on hydropower, and includes the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world.
In 1960, with a newly installed democratic government, Hydrocarbons Minister Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso led the creation of OPEC, the consortium of oil-producing countries aiming to support the price of oil.
Under Hugo Chávez a 2001 law placed limits on foreign investment.
As a result of the strike, around 40% of the company's workforce (around 18,000 workers) were dismissed for "dereliction of duty" during the strike.
Venezuela has a road network of nearly in length, placing the country around 45th in the world; around a third of roads are paved.
==Demographics==Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital Caracas, which is also the largest city.
About 93% of the population lives in urban areas in northern Venezuela; 73% live less than from the coastline.
Though almost half of Venezuela's land area lies south of the Orinoco, only 5% of Venezuelans live there.
Practically half of the population claimed to be "moreno", a term used throughout Ibero-America that in this case means "dark-skinned" or "brown-skinned", as opposed to having a lighter skin (this term connotes skin color or tone, rather than facial features or descent).
Ethnic minorities in Venezuela consist of groups that descend mainly from African or indigenous peoples; 2.8% identified themselves as "black" and 0.7% as "afrodescendiente" (Afro-descendant), 2.6% claimed to belong to indigenous peoples, and 1.2% answered "other races".
Among indigenous people, 58% were Wayúu, 7% Warao, 5% Kariña, 4% Pemón, 3% Piaroa, 3% Jivi, 3% Añu, 3% Cumanágoto, 2% Yukpa, 2% Chaima and 1% Yanomami; the remaining 9% consisted of other indigenous nations.
According to an autosomal DNA genetic study conducted in 2008 by the University of Brasília (UNB), the composition of Venezuela's population is 60.60% of European contribution, 23% of indigenous contribution, and 16.30% of African contribution.
During the colonial period and until after the Second World War, many of the European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands, which had a significant cultural impact on the cuisine and customs of Venezuela.
However, with the start of oil exploitation in the early 20th century, companies from the United States began establishing operations in Venezuela, bringing with them US citizens.
Later, during and after the war, new waves of immigrants from other parts of Europe, the Middle East, and China began; many were encouraged by government-established immigration programs.
Between 1900 and 1958 more than one million Europeans immigrated to Venezuela.
In addition, Venezuela also experienced immigration from other Latin American countries (especially Colombia) in the mid-to-late 19th century.
Between 500,000 and one million illegal immigrants are estimated to be living in the country.
The total indigenous population of the country is estimated at about 500 thousand people (2.8% of the total), distributed among 40 indigenous peoples.
Most indigenous peoples are concentrated in eight states along Venezuela's borders with Brazil, Guyana, and Colombia, and the majority groups are the Wayuu (west), the Warao (east), the Yanomami (south), and the Pemon (southeast).
===Religion===According to government estimates, 92% of the population is Roman Catholic, and the remaining 8% are either irreligious, Protestant, or a member of another religion.
In Venezuela, a population of Santería followers has been growing since 2008.
Spanish influences are evident in bullfights and certain features of gastronomy.
Venezuela was also enriched by other streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially from France.
In the latest stage in the major cities and regions oil of U.S. origin and manifestations of the new immigration of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, increasing the already complex cultural mosaic.
For example, from United States comes the influence of taste for baseball, US-style fast food, and current architectural constructions.
Modernism took over in the 20th century.
===Music===Indigenous musical styles of Venezuela are exemplified by the groups Un Solo Pueblo and Serenata Guayanesa.
The national musical instrument is the cuatro.
The national dance is the "joropo".
In the last years, Classical Music has had great performances.
The Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra, under the baton of its principal conductor Gustavo Dudamel and José Antonio Abreu, has hosted a number of excellent presentations in many European concert halls, notably at the 2007 London Proms, and has received several honors.
===Sport===Baseball is Venezuela's most popular sport, with the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League existing since 1945.
Besides baseball, Venezuela's most popular sports are basketball and football.
Venezuela hosted the 2012 Basketball World Olympic Qualifying Tournament and the 2013 FIBA Basketball Americas Championship, which took place in Poliedro de Caracas.
(2007, 2047, 2087, 2127, 2167, 2207, 2247, 2287...)Venezuela is also home to Formula 1 driver, Pastor Maldonado.
At the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix, he claimed his first pole and victory and became the first and only Venezuelan to have done so in the history of Formula 1.
Among them are hallaca, pabellón criollo, arepas, pisca andina, tarkarí de chivo, jalea de mango, and fried camiguanas.
===Other===Venezuela is well known for its successes in beauty pageants.
Miss Venezuela is a big event in the country, and Venezuela has received 6 Miss World, 7 Miss Universe, 6 Miss International and 2 Miss Earth titles.
Venezuela ranks first in the Global Beauties webpage list as the country with more international pageants titles won.
It also has a Guinness World Record, after Dayana Mendoza, Miss Universe 2008 from Venezuela crowned Stefania Fernandez, also from Venezuela as Miss Universe 2009, marking the first time over 50 years in the competition that a country wins the title in two consecutive years.
Carlos Raúl Villanueva was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a World Heritage Site) and its Aula Magna.
Net secondary enrollment rate was at 63% in 2005.
Venezuela has a number of universities, of which the most prestigious are the Central University of Venezuela (UCV), founded in Caracas in 1721, the University of Zulia (LUZ) founded in 1891, the University of the Andes (ULA), founded in Mérida State in 1810, and Simón Bolívar University (USB), founded in Miranda State in 1967.
==Health==Venezuela has a national universal health care system.
Infant mortality in Venezuela is 19.33 deaths per 1,000 births for 2014, lower than the South American average (by comparison, the U.S. stands at 5.9 deaths per 1,000 births in 2013).
Venezuela has a total of 150 plants for sewage treatment.
However, still 13% of the population lack access to drinking water, but this number has been dropping.

Modern measurements place this moment at approximately 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe.
The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were hydrogen, along with helium and traces of lithium.
Based on measurements of the expansion using Type Ia supernovae, measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, and measurements of the correlation function of galaxies, the universe has an estimated age of 13.798 ± 0.037 billion years.
In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with an incredibly high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling.
This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.
The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons.
A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons.
As the universe cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon radiation.
After about 379,000 years the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded.
The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the universe.
The best measurements available (from WMAP) show that the data is well-fit by a Lambda-CDM model in which dark matter is assumed to be cold (warm dark matter is ruled out by early reionization), and is estimated to make up about 23% of the matter/energy of the universe, while baryonic matter makes up about 4.6%.
In an "extended model" which includes hot dark matter in the form of neutrinos, then if the "physical baryon density" Ωbh2 is estimated at about 0.023 (this is different from the 'baryon density' Ωb expressed as a fraction of the total matter/energy density, which as noted above is about 0.046), and the corresponding cold dark matter density Ωch2 is about 0.11, the corresponding neutrino density Ωvh2 is estimated to be less than 0.0062.
The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form.
When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion.
These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them.
For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant over much of the age of the universe is of order 10−5.
To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the CMB.
This defines a "future horizon", which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence.
The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our universe.
After World War II, two distinct possibilities emerged.
In this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time.
Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.
However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.
Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly scattered from free charged particles.
In 1989 NASA launched the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE).
Its findings were consistent with predictions regarding the CMB, finding a residual temperature of 2.726 K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.725 K) and providing the first evidence for fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB, at a level of about one part in 105.
In early 2003 the first results of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters.
This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of CMB fluctuations.
The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for /, about 10−3 for /, about 10−4 for / and about 10−9 for /.
This provides direct evidence that there was a period in the history of the universe before the formation of the first stars, when most ordinary matter existed in the form of clouds of neutral hydrogen.
On 17 March 2014, astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced the apparent detection of primordial gravitational waves, which, if confirmed, may provide strong evidence for inflation and the Big Bang.
However, on 19 June 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the findings was reported; and on 19 September 2014, even more lowered confidence.
Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems.
Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density.
Negative pressure is believed to be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang.
Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.
This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter.
Computer simulations that matched the observations of the stellar populations of globular clusters suggested that they were about 15 billion years old, which conflicted with the 13.8 billion year age of the universe.
This issue was partially resolved in the late 1990s when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters.
The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat.
For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes(the time of nucleosynthesis), the universe density must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.
Pragmatism is a rejection of the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality.
Instead, pragmatists consider thought to be a product of the interaction between organism and environment.
Thus, the function of thought is as an instrument or tool for prediction, action, and problem solving.
However, the phrase is often confused with "pragmatism" in the context of politics (which refers to politics or diplomacy based primarily on practical considerations, rather than ideological notions) and with a non-technical use of "pragmatism" in ordinary contexts referring to dealing with matters inone's life realistically and in a way that is based on practical rather than abstract considerations.
Doubt, like belief, requires justification.
It arises from confrontation with some specific recalcitrant matter of fact (which Dewey called a 'situation'), which unsettles our belief in some specific proposition.
Note that anti-skepticism is a reaction to modern academic skepticism in the wake of Descartes.
William James wrote:In reality, James asserts, the theory is a great deal more subtle.
For example, to believe my cheating spouse is faithful may help me feel better now, but it is certainly not useful from a more long-term perspective because it doesn't accord with the facts (and is therefore not true).
Pragmatists who work in these fields share a common inspiration, but their work is diverse and there are no received views.
===Philosophy of science===In the philosophy of science, instrumentalism is the view that concepts and theories are merely useful instruments and progress in science cannot be couched in terms of concepts and theories somehow mirroring reality.
Instrumentalism does not state that truth doesn't matter, but rather provides a specific answer to the question of what truth and falsity mean and how they function in science.
Schiller sought to undermine the very possibility of formal logic, by showing that words only had meaning when used in context.
What he offers is something philosophers would recognize today as a logic covering the context of discovery and the hypothetico-deductive method.
===Metaphysics===James and Dewey were empirical thinkers in the most straightforward fashion: experience is the ultimate test and experience is what needs to be explained.
To the pragmatists, this went against the spirit of empiricism: we should try to explain all that is given in experience including connections and meaning, instead of explaining them away and positing sense data as the ultimate reality.
===Philosophy of mind===Both John Dewey in "Experience and Nature" (1929) and half a century later Richard Rorty in his monumental "Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature" (1979) argued that much of the debate about the relation of the mind to the body results from conceptual confusions.
===Ethics===Pragmatism sees no fundamental difference between practical and theoretical reason, nor any ontological difference between facts and values.
Both facts and values have cognitive content: knowledge is what we should believe; values are hypotheses about what is good in action.
*1975 – Papua New Guinea gains independence from Australia.
The center of the state is dominated by the Central Valley, a major agricultural area.
At least half of the fruit produced in the United States is now cultivated in California, and the state also leads in the production of vegetables.
Between 2000 and 2009, there was a natural increase of 3,090,016 (5,058,440 births minus 2,179,958 deaths).
During this time period, international migration produced a net increase of 1,816,633 people while domestic migration produced a net decrease of 1,509,708, resulting in a net in-migration of 306,925 people.
The state of California's own statistics show a population of 38,292,687 for January 1, 2009.
California is the second-most-populous sub-national entity in the Western Hemisphere and the Americas, with a population second to that of State of São Paulo, Brazil.
The center of population of California is located in the town of Buttonwillow, Kern County.
The state has the 5th largest population of African Americans in the U.S., an estimated 2,250,000 residents.
California's Native American population of 285,000 is the most of any state.
The official language of California has been English since the passage of Proposition 63 in 1986.
However, many state, city, and local government agencies still continue to print official public documents in numerous languages.
The five largest sectors of employment in California are trade, transportation, and utilities; government; professional and business services; education and health services; and leisure and hospitality.
In output, the five largest sectors are financial services, followed by trade, transportation, and utilities; education and health services; government; and manufacturing.
Agriculture is an important sector in California's economy.
This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability.
Property tax increases are capped at 2% per year (see Proposition 13).
*1991 – Estonia, North Korea, South Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia join the United Nations.
Sexual orientation is an enduring pattern of romantic or sexual attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of the opposite sex or gender, the same sex or gender, or to both sexes or more than one gender.
* Residential density: The number of people living in an urban area / area of residential land.
The southern continent is called Aphrodite Terra, after the Greek goddess of love, and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of South America.
The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.
This is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older.
On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show a range of states of degradation.
No craters are smaller than 3 km, because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects.
Objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed down so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater.
The atmospheric mass is 93 times that of Earth's atmosphere, whereas the pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times that at Earth's surface—a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1 kilometre under Earth's oceans.
This makes the Venusian surface hotter than Mercury's, which has a minimum surface temperature of and maximum surface temperature of , even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only 25% of Mercury's solar irradiance.
From the year 1 to 5383, there are 526 approaches less than 40 million km; then there are none for about 60,158 years.
An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.
The transit of Venus was first observed in 1032 by the Persian astronomer Avicenna, who concluded Venus is closer to Earth than the Sun, and established Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun.
These three features are now the only ones on Venus that do not have female names.
Mariner 2 also obtained improved estimates of its mass and of the astronomical unit, but was unable to detect either a magnetic field or radiation belts.
Probably tilted onto its side, it returned a weak signal, supplying temperature data for 23 minutes, the first telemetry received from the surface of another planet.
In 1985, the Soviet Union took advantage of the opportunity to combine missions to Venus and Comet Halley, which passed through the inner Solar System that year.
The Fifth Crusade (1213–1221) was an attempt by Catholic Europeans to reacquire Jerusalem and the rest of the Holy Land by first conquering the powerful Ayyubid state in Egypt.
The null data type represents a variable that has no value; "NULL" is the only allowed value for this data type.
This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.
Franz Boas (1858–1942) was trained in this tradition, and he brought it with him when he left Germany for the United States.
Nevertheless, they saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by relations of production, which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.
In the United States, "Cultural Studies" focuses largely on the study of popular culture, that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods.
Richard Hoggart coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies or CCCS.
As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts.
These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture.
This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and Paul Gilroy.
The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.
Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a Marxist model to the field.
Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view.

Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications.
Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation – moving data, carrying out a computation, or altering the control flow of instructions.
Data movement is typically from one place in memory to another.
Software can be tested through unit testing, regression testing and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly, automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large.

Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of the PRC and India have been growing rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%.
In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the USA as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$.
Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore.
Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.
Asia has four main financial centers: Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai.
For instance, according to Ethnologue, more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines.
China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2.
He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not have a triple point temperature at which the solid, liquid, and gas phases are at equilibrium.
This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.
Solid helium has a density of 0.214 ± 0.006 g/cm3 at 1.15 K and 66 atm; the projected density at 0 K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187 ± 0.009 g/cm3.
When helium II boils, due to its high thermal conductivity it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface.
Of the 2008 world helium total production of about 32 million kg (193 million standard cubic meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 22% of the total in 2008) is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners.
Europe, in particular ancient Greece, is the birthplace of Western culture.
It played a predominant role in global affairs from the 15th century onwards, especially after the beginning of colonialism.
Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European nations controlled at various times the Americas, most of Africa, Oceania, and the overwhelming majority of Asia.
Both world wars were largely focused upon Europe, greatly contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the United States and Soviet Union took prominence.
During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east.
Stallman wanted computer users to be "free", as most were in the 1960s and 1970s – free to study the source code of the software they use, free to share the software with other people, free to modify the behavior of the software, and free to publish their modified versions of the software.
This philosophy was later published as the GNU Manifesto in March 1985.
In October 1985, Stallman set up the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
The most prominent and successful of these was Cygnus Solutions, now part of Red Hat.
This idea is often referred to as copyleft.

Firewall technology emerged in the late 1980s when the Internet was a fairly new technology in terms of its global use and connectivity.
The term "packet filter" originated in the context of BSD operating systems.
Originally, the NAT function was developed to address the limited number of IPv4 routable addresses that could be used or assigned to companies or individuals as well as reduce both the amount and therefore cost of obtaining enough public addresses for every computer in an organization.
Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer market with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984.
Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends MS-DOS.
The shell of Windows 1.0 is a program known as the MS-DOS Executive.
Windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated keyboard shortcuts and could make use of expanded memory.
In addition to full Windows-packages, there were runtime-only versions that shipped with early Windows software from third parties and made it possible to run their Windows software on MS-DOS and without the full Windows feature set.
===Windows 3.0 and 3.1===Windows 3.0, released in 1990, improved the design, mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers (VxDs) that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications.
Windows 3.0 is the first Microsoft Windows version to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months.
Windows 3.1, made generally available on March 1, 1992, featured a facelift.
Support for Windows 3.1 ended on December 31, 2001.
Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000 and extended support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001.
In May 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98 Second Edition, an updated version of Windows 98.
Mainstream support for Windows 98 ended on June 30, 2002 and extended support for Windows 98 ended on July 11, 2006.
On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released Windows 2000, a successor to NT 4.0.
Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009.
Extended support ended on April 8, 2014.
====Windows Vista and later====After a lengthy development process, Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006 for volume licensing and January 30, 2007 for consumers.
It contained a number of new features, from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes, with a particular focus on security features.
Windows 8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012.
On April 25, 2005, Microsoft released Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the x86-64 (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture.
x64 is still supported.
Windows CE was the core from which Windows Mobile was derived.
Its successor, Windows Phone 7, was based on components from both Windows CE 6.0 R3 and Windows CE 7.0.
Windows Phone 8 however, is based on the same NT-kernel as Windows 8.
In versions of Windows after and including Windows 2000 SP3 and Windows XP, updates can be automatically downloaded and installed if the user selects to do so.
Windows Vista changes this by introducing a privilege elevation system called User Account Control.
In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system.
User applications, including the Windows Shell, are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account.
However using this process of AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders.
===Windows Defender===On January 6, 2005, Microsoft released a Beta version of Microsoft AntiSpyware, based upon the previously released Giant AntiSpyware.
===Third-party analysis===In an article based on a report by Symantec, internetnews.com has described Microsoft Windows as having the "fewest number of patches and the shortest average patch development time of the five operating systems it monitored in the last six months of 2006.
It has been in the development stage since 1996.

Mauritania was part of the larger French colony of French West Africa and, as such, had no capital during the colonial period: Saint-Louis, in Senegal, held that position.
In 1958, Mauritania was formed as an autonomous republic in the French Community, and in 1960 it became an independent country, with Nouakchott as its capital.
Between 1988 and 1989, racial tensions between Arabs and blacks escalated.
Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million; more conservative estimates put that number at 800,000, estimated to be close to one-third of the country's population.
In 2000, there were over 30 small or middle-size factories in the city.
==Education==The city is home to the University of Nouakchott, which is the only university in Mauritania and was opened in 1981.
Other higher education facilities include the National School of Administration and the National Institute of Advanced Islamic Studies.
One beach is devoted to fishing boats where fish can be bought fresh.
Once the hydrogen fuel at the core is exhausted, a star with at least 0.4 times the mass of the Sun expands to become a red giant, in some cases fusing heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core.
The star then evolves into a degenerate form, recycling a portion of its matter into the interstellar environment, where it will contribute to the formation of a new generation of stars with a higher proportion of heavy elements.
Meanwhile, the core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or (if it is sufficiently massive) a black hole.
The oldest accurately dated star chart appeared in ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC.
The first star catalogue in Greek astronomy was created by Aristillus in approximately 300 BC, with the help of Timocharis.
Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy.
In 185 AD, they were the first to observe and write about a supernova, now known as the SN 185.
</ref>Medieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic names to many stars that are still used today, and they invented numerous astronomical instruments that could compute the positions of the stars.
By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers.
William Herschel was the first astronomer to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky.
During the 1780s, he performed a series of gauges in 600 directions, and counted the stars observed along each line of sight.
From this he deduced that the number of stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky, in the direction of the Milky Way core.
His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction.
The first direct measurement of the distance to a star (61 Cygni at 11.4 light-years) was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel using the parallax technique.
Important theoretical work on the physical structure of stars occurred during the first decades of the twentieth century.
Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution.
With the exception of supernovae, individual stars have primarily been observed in our Local Group of galaxies, and especially in the visible part of the Milky Way (as demonstrated by the detailed star catalogues available for ourgalaxy).
The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.
However, the IAU has disassociated itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither recognized by the IAU nor used by them.
==Units of measurement==Although stellar parameters can be expressed in SI units or CGS units, it is often most convenient to express mass, luminosity, and radii in solar units, based on the characteristics of the Sun:Large lengths, such as the radius of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system, are often expressed in terms of the astronomical unit (AU)—approximately the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or 93 million miles).
The period of gravitational contraction lasts about 10 to 15 million years.
Such stars are said to be on the main sequence and are called dwarf stars.
Stars that begin with more than 50 can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence.
The duration that a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has to fuse and the rate at which it fuses that fuel, i.e.
For the Sun, its life is estimated to be about 10 billion (1010) years.
Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly.
Stars less massive than 0.25 , called red dwarfs, are able to fuse nearly all of their mass as fuel while stars of about 1 can only use about 10% of their mass as fuel.
The combination of their slow fuel-consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows about 0.25 stars to last for about one trillion (1012) years according to stellar-evolution calculations, while the least-massive hydrogen-fusing stars (0.08 ) will last for about 12 trillion years.
However, since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years), no stars under about 0.85 are expected to have moved off the main sequence.
In about 5 billion years, when the Sun enters this phase, it will expand to a maximum radius of roughly , 250 times its present size.
As a giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its current mass.
In a red giant of up to 2.25 , hydrogen fusion proceeds in a shell surrounding the core.
Eventually the core is compressed enough to start helium fusion, and the star now gradually shrinks in radius and its surface temperature increases.
If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth, known as a white dwarf.
In larger stars, fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large (more than 1.4 ) that it can no longer support its own mass.
In a neutron star the matter is in a state known as neutron-degenerate matter, with a more exotic form of degenerate matter, QCD matter, possibly present in the core.
Within a black hole the matter is in a state that is not currently understood.
This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems.
As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.
A typical galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars, and there are more than 100 billion (1011) galaxies in the observable universe.
While it is often believed that stars only exist within galaxies, intergalactic stars have been discovered.
The nearest star to the Earth, apart from the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, which is 39.9 trillion kilometres, or 4.2 light-years away.
Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle (8 kilometres per second—almost 30,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to get there.
Distances like this are typical inside galactic discs, including in the vicinity of the solar system.
Stars can be much closer to each other in the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters, or much farther apart in galactic halos.
===Age===Most stars are between 1 billion and 10 billion years old.
Some stars may even be close to 13.8 billion years old—the observed age of the universe.
The oldest star yet discovered, HD 140283, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an estimated 14.46 ± 0.8 billion years old.
===Chemical composition===When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements.
Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure.
The star with the lowest iron content ever measured is the dwarf HE1327-2326, with only 1/200,000th the iron content of the Sun.
===Diameter===Due to their great distance from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points in the night sky that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere.
The Sun is also a star, but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight.
Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.
Betelgeuse, however, has a much lower density than the Sun.
Young, rapidly rotating stars tend to have high levels of surface activity because of their magnetic field.
A study of the Arches cluster suggests that is the upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe.
The reason for this limit is not precisely known, but it is partially due to the Eddington luminosity which defines the maximum amount of luminosity that can pass through the atmosphere of a star without ejecting the gases into space.
However, a star named R136a1 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, RMC 136a star cluster has been measured at 265 , which puts this limit into question.
A study determined that stars larger than 150 in R136 were created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close binary systems, providing a way to sidestep the 150 limit.
The first stars to form after the Big Bang may have been larger, up to 300 or more, due to the complete absence of elements heavier than lithium in their composition.
With a mass only 93 times that of Jupiter (), AB Doradus C, a companion to AB Doradus A, is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core.
Smaller bodies are called brown dwarfs, which occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and gas giants.
This rate of rotation is just below the critical velocity of 300 km/s where the star would break apart.
By contrast, the Sun only rotates once every 25 – 35 days, with an equatorial velocity of 1.994 km/s.
A large portion of the star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind.
In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid.
The pulsar at the heart of the Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second.
Surface patches with a lower temperature and luminosity than average are known as starspots.
Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity and is what the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).
Both the apparent and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one whole number difference in magnitude is equal to a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512).
This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and approximately 100 times brighter than a sixth magnitude star (+6.00).
The faintest stars visible to the naked eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.
This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.
This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun.
The least luminous stars that are currently known are located in the NGC 6397 cluster.
Most stars belong to the main sequence, which consists of ordinary hydrogen-burning stars.
This is followed by a numerical value that indicates the temperature index.
The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion.
Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.
A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which regularly varies in magnitude from 2.3 to 3.5 over a period of 2.87 days.
The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core.
The occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the mass.
Red dwarf stars with less than 0.4 are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a helium core.
For most stars the convective zones will also vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.
Above the level of the photosphere is the stellar atmosphere.
In a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere is the thin chromosphere region, where spicules appear and stellar flares begin.
The existence of a corona appears to be dependent on a convective zone in the outer layers of the star.
The corona region of the Sun is normally only visible during a solar eclipse.
The net mass of the fused atomic nuclei is smaller than the sum of the constituents.
In the Sun, with a 10-million-kelvin core, hydrogen fuses to form helium in the proton-proton chain reaction::41H → 22H + 2e+ + 2νe (4.0 MeV + 1.0 MeV):21H + 22H → 23He + 2γ (5.5 MeV):23He → 4He + 21H (12.9 MeV)These reactions result in the overall reaction::41H → 4He + 2e+ + 2γ + 2νe (26.7 MeV)where e+ is a positron, γ is a gamma ray photon, νe is a neutrino, and H and He are isotopes of hydrogen and helium, respectively.
The energy released by this reaction is in millions of electron volts, which is actually only a tiny amount of energy.
Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol).
The discovery of this procedure henceforth led to commercial production of lithium, beginning in 1923, by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.
The United States became the prime producer of lithium in the period between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s.

==Who is a Jew?==Judaism shares some of the characteristics of a nation, an ethnicity, a religion, and a culture, making the definition of who is a Jew vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity is used.
According to the 2007 estimates of The Jewish People Policy Planning Institute, the world's Jewish population is 13.2 million.
====Israel====Israel, the Jewish nation-state, is the only country in which Jews make up a majority of the citizens.
Israel was established as an independent democratic and Jewish state on May 14, 1948.
Of the 120 members in its parliament, the Knesset, currently, 12 members of the Knesset are Arab citizens of Israel, most representing Arab political parties.
One of Israel's Supreme Court judges is also an Arab citizen of Israel.
Between 1948 and 1958, the Jewish population rose from 800,000 to two million.
Currently, Jews account for 75.4% of the Israeli population, or 6 million people.
Israel also has a large population of Ethiopian Jews, many of whom were airlifted to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Between 1974 and 1979 nearly 227,258 immigrants arrived in Israel, about half being from the Soviet Union.
This period also saw an increase in immigration to Israel from Western Europe, Latin America, and North America.
Elsewhere in the Americas, there are also large Jewish populations in Canada (315,000), Argentina (180,000-300,000), and Brazil (196,000-600,000), and smaller populations in Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia and several other countries (see History of the Jews in Latin America).
Demographers disagree on whether the United States has a larger Jewish population than Israel, with many maintaining that Israel surpassed the United States in Jewish population during the 2000s, while others maintain that the United States still has the largest Jewish population in the world.
Western Europe's largest Jewish community, and the third-largest Jewish community in the world, can be found in France, home to between 483,000 and 500,000 Jews, the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from North African Arab countries such as Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia (or their descendants).
In Eastern Europe, there are anywhere from 350,000 to one million Jews living in the former Soviet Union, but exact figures are difficult to establish.
In Germany, the 102,000 Jews registered with the Jewish community are a slowly declining population, despite the immigration of tens of thousands of Jews from the former Soviet Union since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Thousands of Israelis also live in Germany, either permanently or temporarily, for economic reasons.
Instead, a variety of secular and religious institutions at the local, national, and international levels lead various parts of the Jewish community on a variety of issues.

The city has experienced very high rates of population growth, from 150,000 inhabitants in the 1960s to over 5 million, according to the most recent sources.
==Sports==Football is the most popular sport in Riyadh.
There is also Al-Riyadh Club, which was established in 1954, as well as many other minor clubs.
The stadium hosted the FIFA Confederations Cup three times, in the years 1992, 1995 and 1997.

Said then joined the faculty of Columbia University in 1963, where he became professor of English and comparative literature in 1991.
It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport.
The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.
The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863.
The Cambridge Rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football.
The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by C. W. Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872.
FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.
The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.
Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world.
Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet.
A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level.
According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football.
The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.
Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to be involved in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.
For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.
==Laws==There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines.
The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game.
Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.
The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number.
From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee.
A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a dismissal.
There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles.
Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status as the World Cup.
These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa América (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC).
At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion.
In the first two-thirds of the 20th century, the Hamitic race was, in fact, considered one of the branches of the Caucasian race, along with the Indo-Europeans, Semites, and the Mediterranean race.
Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air.

==Structure, growth and development==Most of the solid material in a plant is taken from the atmosphere.
Through a process known as photosynthesis, most plants use the energy in sunlight to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, plus water, into simple sugars.
) These sugars are then used as building blocks and form the main structural component of the plant.
For the majority of plants to grow successfully they also require oxygen in the atmosphere and around their roots (soil gas) for respiration.
Biotic factors are also capable of affecting plant growth.
Plants compete with other plants for space, water, light and nutrients.
The growth rate of plants is extremely variable.
Some mosses grow less than 0.001 millimeters per hour (mm/h), while most trees grow 0.025-0.250 mm/h.
Some climbing species, such as kudzu, which do not need to produce thick supportive tissue, may grow up to 12.5 mm/h.
No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation.
Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which "they could be followed by a computing machine", or by a "human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.
== Formalization ==Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data.
So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of imperative programming.
This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, "mechanical" means.
Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the assignment operation, setting the value of a variable.
It derives from the intuition of "memory" as a scratchpad.
There is an example below of such an assignment.
Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms.
Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements.
Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer, but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.
There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given Turing machine program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at finite state machine, state transition table and control table), as flowcharts and drakon-charts (see more at state diagram), or as a form of rudimentary machine code or assembly code called "sets of quadruples" (see more at Turing machine).
Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:; 1 High-level description: "...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details.
At this level we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head.
"; 2 Implementation description: "...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape.
At this level we do not give details of states or transition function.
"; 3 Formal description: Most detailed, "lowest level", gives the Turing machine's "state table".
For an example of the simple algorithm "Add m+n" described in all three levels, see Algorithm examples.
== Algorithmic analysis ==It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm.
Methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O("n"), using the big O notation with "n" as the length of the list.
At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list.
Estimating the fair price for financial instruments using the Black–Scholes model is a complex algorithmic calculation.
The English word derives from the Latin "calculus", which originally meant a small stone in the gall-bladder (from Latin "calx").
It also meant a pebble used for calculating, or a small stone used as a counter in an abacus (Latin "abacus", Greek "abax").

Approximately 62% of the world's Muslims live in Asia, with over 683 million adherents in Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh.
In the Middle East, non-Arab countries such as Turkey and Iran are the largest Muslim-majority countries; in Africa, Egypt and Nigeria have the most populous Muslim communities.
Most estimates indicate that the People's Republic of China has approximately 20 to 30 million Muslims (1.5% to 2% of the population).
Islam is the second largest religion after Christianity in many European countries,and is slowly catching up to that status in the Americas, with between 2,454,000, according to Pew Forum, and approximately 7 million Muslims, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), in the United States.
In late 1999, a group of dissatisfied officers staged a military coup, putting General Robert Guéï in power.
International organizations reported numerous human rights violations by both sides.
=== Ethnic groups ===Ethnic groups include Akan 42.1%, Voltaiques or Gur 17.6%, Northern Mandes 16.5%, Krous 11%, Southern Mandes 10%, other 2.8% (includes 30,000 Lebanese and 45,000 French; 2004).
77% of the population are considered Ivoirians.
Since Ivory Coast has established itself as one of the most successful West African nations, about 20% of the population (about 3.4 million) consists of workers from neighbouring Liberia, Burkina Faso and Guinea.
4% of the population is of non-African ancestry.
Many are French, Lebanese, Vietnamese and Spanish citizens, as well as Protestant missionaries from the United States and Canada.
===National government===As the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's national government.
Government ministries are located in various parts of the city; many are located in the 7th arrondissement, near the Matignon.
While the Paris region's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan France in 2011, the Paris region's GDP accounted for 31 percent of metropolitan France's GDP.
As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the "City of Art".
Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs.
Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royals commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era.
Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million children and students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.
It comprises 300 stations (384 stops) connected by of rails, and 16 lines, identified by numbers from 1 to 14, with two minor lines, 3bis and 7bis.
She died in 1976 at the age of 68.
The Muhammad al-Durrah incident took place in the Gaza Strip on September 30, 2000, on the second day of the Second Intifada, amid widespread rioting throughout the Palestinian territories.
Three senior French journalists who saw the raw footage in 2004 said it was not clear from the footage alone that the boy had died, and that France 2 cut a final few seconds in which he appeared to lift his hand from his face.
Israeli writer Helen Schary Motro came to know him when she had employed him to help build her house.
She wrote in 2000 of his years of rising at 3:30 am to catch the bus to the border crossing at four, then a second bus out of Gaza so he could be at work by six.
The border was closed on the day of the incident because of the rioting, which is why Jamal was not at work.
His mother said he had been watching the rioting on television and asked if he could join in.
He began in journalism in 1971, and after studying film and television he started working for France 2 in 1981, becoming their bureau chief in Israel in 1990.
He is the author of several books about the Middle East, and is highly respected within the French establishment.
He ran his own press office, the National News Center in Gaza, and contributed to CNN through the Al-Wataneya Press Office.
He studied business administration in the U.S., and was a board member of the Palestinian Journalists' Association.
Daniel Seaman, director of the Israeli government press office, accused Abu Rahma on September 23, 2007 of the "systematic staging of action scenes," with reference to the al-Durrah footage, in a letter France 2 said was full of slander and half-truths.
I will never use journalism for anything ... because journalism is my religion.
Fallows writes that one camera caught a man being loaded into an ambulance, while footage from a different camera shows the same man jumping out of the ambulance a few minutes later.
According to Israeli spokesmen, the soldiers were under orders to fire only if they were fired at, and not in response to rocks or other objects being thrown at them.
The discrepancies have not been resolved; see below.
The shooting started again, and Jamal, Muhammad, and Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, crouched against the concrete wall in the upper left/south east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across from the Israeli outpost.
He swore in an affidavit on October 3, 2000, that he had filmed 27 minutes of the incident which he said had lasted 45 minutes.
" Abu Rahma said shooting was also coming from the Palestinian National Security Forces outpost south of the junction, behind the spot where Jamal and Muhammad were crouching, but he said they were not shooting when Muhammad was hit.
An affidavit sworn by Abu Rahma on October 3, 2000, says the Israeli soldiers shot the boy in cold blood: "I can assert that shooting at the child Mohammed and his father Jamal came from the above-mentioned Israeli military outpost, as it was the only place from which shooting at the child and his father was possible.
===Israeli response===The position of the Israeli government and IDF changed over time, from accepting responsibility in October 2000 to retracting that admission in September 2007.
The day after the shooting, the IDF issued a statement saying it was impossible to determine the origin of the fire.
On October 3, the Israeli army's chief of operations, Major-General Giora Eiland, said the shots had apparently been fired by Israeli soldiers; the soldiers had been shooting from small slits in the wall, he said, and had not had a clear field of vision.
There is confusion about when the incident occurred, how much footage was shot, why it was blurred at the moment the shots were fired, why France 2 cut the final scene, and what time the boy arrived at the hospital.
There is no evidence that bullets were recovered, whether from the scene, from the bodies, or from Jamal.
The general told Schapira that he had no bullets, and that there had been no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt as to who had shot the boy.
When told the general had no bullets, Abu Rahma said that France 2 had collected bullets at the scene.
He said: "We have some secrets for ourselves ... We cannot give anything ...
James Fallows wrote in "The Atlantic" in 2003 that Jamal and Muhammad first made an appearance in the footage at 3:00 pm (GMT+3), arguing that the time can be judged by later comments from Jamal and some journalists on the scene, and by the length of the shadows.
Brian Whitaker wrote in "The Guardian" in 2000 that the news first arrived in London from the Associated Press at 6:00 pm BST (GMT+1), followed minutes later by a similar report from Reuters.
A boy wrapped in a Palestinian flag, with his face exposed, who Fallows said looked like Muhammad, was carried through the streets of the refugee camp in front of thousands of mourners.
Several news organizations said this occurred on the evening of September 30.
Enderlin said that Shahaf wrote to him requesting a copy of the unedited footage, saying it was for "various professional audiences, including film schools," with the name of a company, Eye to Eye Communications, next to his signature.
They fired into the reconstructed concrete wall from different angles, and found that, to produce a round hole, they had to fire from more or less straight on.
It was shown to the head of Israeli military intelligence, and the key points were presented to the media in November 2000 as not ruling out that the IDF had shot the boy, though describing it as unlikely.
In February 2005, Shahaf presented his views to the American Academy of Forensic Sciences.
He said the evidence of the doctors was not consistent with photographs of the boy's body, suggesting that the dead boy in the photographs was not al-Durrah, that the body had reached the hospital before the incident was reported to have started, and that the signs of injury on the boy's body were not consistent with fresh blood.
Abu Rahma said that the gunfight lasted 45 minutes, and that he filmed about 27 minutes of it.
" Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the end, during which the boy appears to lift his hand away from his face, leading critics to say he was peeking at the camera.
The issue of how much footage exists was further confused in November 2007.
The court of appeal asked to see the footage, and in November 2007, France 2 presented the court with just 18 minutes of footage.
Enderlin then seemed to say there had never been 27 minutes of footage; according to "The Jerusalem Post", he said just before the screening, "I do not know where this 27 minutes comes from.
In all there were only 18 minutes of footage shot in Gaza.
The journalists asked to speak to the cameraman, who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 told them he did not speak French and that his English was not good enough.
"The first 23 minutes of the footage showed Palestinians playing at war for the cameras, they said, falling down as if wounded, then getting up and walking away.
He wrote that he had said the bullets were fired by the Israelis because he trusted the cameraman, who had worked for France 2 since 1988.
"The image corresponded to the reality of the situation," he wrote, "not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank.
He said that, from 29 September to late October 2000, 118 Palestinians were killed, including 33 under the age of 18, compared to 11 adult Israelis killed during the same period.
===Esther Schapira documentaries=======2002: "Drei Kugeln und ein totes Kind"====In March 2002, the German network ARD broadcast "Drei Kugeln und ein totes Kind" ("Three Bullets and a Dead child") by Esther Schapira.
He said he fed six minutes back to Jerusalem, which he described as "from the shooting to the end.
One of them said they knew something was about to happen because of the number of camera crews that had gathered; Schapira said that at least 10 Palestinian photographers and camera crews working for Western news agencies had assembled at the junction.
One of the soldiers said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as "the twins"—see the lower right quadrant of this image.
In the view of the soldier, the shooting was no accident, because the range was too close and the visibility too good, but the fire did not come from the Israeli position, he said.
He said Schapira had not succeeded in ruling out that the IDF had killed the boy, but had shown that it was impossible to say with certainty that they did.
Hospital records show that, at midday, a young boy was examined in the pathology department.
That evening, before dusk, the funeral took place in the al-Bureij refugee camp, about one hour away by car.
"The assumption that the boy in the footage was also the boy in the hospital morgue may not have been correct, Schapira suggested.
Schapira also argued that there was no blood in the France 2 footage, except for one red mark that she said was a red piece of cloth.
There were no blood stains by the concrete drum in some of the footage taken the next day, and in the images that show blood stains, she argued that the color of the blood was too bright given the time that had elapsed.
===Allegations about father's injuries===On December 13, 2007, Israel's Channel 10 aired an interview with Dr. Yehuda David, a physician at Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv.
David said the scars Jamal presented as bullet wounds from the 2000 incident were actually scars from a tendon repair operation that David performed in 1994.
David made the same assertions in an interview with a "Daniel Vavinsky," published in "Actualité Juive" (Jewish News) on September 4, 2008.
The French court ruled that there was not enough information to determine the cause of al-Durrah's wounds.
The ruling only determined that the publication was not considered libel under French law.
This purposeful choice presented the verdict as a victory to Israeli public diplomacy and as proof that Palestinians are using false propaganda in order to delegitimize Israel.
Even further, some of the media outlets presented the verdict as proof that the IDF could not be held responsible for Mohammad's death.
The case began on September 14, 2006.
We presented a DVD that was made in front of a bailiff from the original tape... not from the various copies you can find here and there.
The court heard that the boy put his hand to his forehead and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, and that there was no blood on the boy's shirt.
Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying, though the cameraman himself told National Public Radio on October 1, 2000 that he had said out loud, "the boy got killed," when he saw Muhammad lying in his father's lap.
This position did not appear in the cameraman's report; see the image on the left above.
" He said there was no evidence that the boy was wounded in his right leg or abdomen, as reported, and that if the injuries were genuine, they did not occur at the time of the televised events.
Had the shots come from the Israeli position, he wrote, only the lower limbs could have been hit.
There were calls for a public inquiry from historian Élie Barnavi, a former Israeli ambassador to France, and Richard Prasquier, president of the Council of Jewish Organisations in France.
Arab countries issued postage stamps bearing the images, parks and streets were named in Muhammad's honor, and Osama bin Laden mentioned Muhammad in a "warning" to President George Bush after 9/11.
Like other battle images, the authenticity of the footage was questioned precisely because it was so potent.

It has been estimated that the solid earth as a whole contains 730 ppm of carbon, with 2000 ppm in the core and 120 ppm in the combined mantle and crust.
In combination with oxygen in carbon dioxide, carbon is found in the Earth's atmosphere (approximately 810 gigatonnes of carbon) and dissolved in all water bodies (approximately 36,000 gigatonnes of carbon).

The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface.
It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, by Antarctica).
As one component of the World Ocean, the Indian Ocean is delineated from the Atlantic Ocean by the 20° east meridian running south from Cape Agulhas, and from the Pacific Ocean by the meridian of 146°55' east.
The northernmost extent of the Indian Ocean is approximately 30° north in the Persian Gulf.
North of 50° south latitude, 86% of the main basin is covered by pelagic sediments, of which more than half is globigerina ooze.
The remaining 14% is layered with terrigenous sediments.
===Climate===The climate north of the equator is affected by a monsoon climate.
Strong north-east winds blow from October until April; from May until October south and west winds prevail.
In the Arabian Sea the violent Monsoon brings rain to the Indian subcontinent.
In the southern hemisphere, the winds are generally milder, but summer storms near Mauritius can be severe.
During the winter monsoon, however, currents in the north are reversed.
Deep water circulation is controlled primarily by inflows from the Atlantic Ocean, the Red Sea, and Antarctic currents.
Surface water salinity ranges from 32 to 37 parts per 1000, the highest occurring in the Arabian Sea and in a belt between southern Africa and south-western Australia.
The Mascarene Plateau is 2000 km long undersea plateau that lies east of Madagascar.
It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from the oil fields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia.
They dominated trade and discovery along the coasts of Africa, and Asia until the mid 17th century.
Spain established a major trading operation in the Philippines and the Pacific.
By 1815, Britain became the principal power in the Indian Ocean.
Since World War II the United Kingdom was forced to withdraw from the area, to be replaced by India, the USSR, and the United States.
On 26 December 2004, the countries surrounding the Indian Ocean were hit by a tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.
The waves resulted in more than 226,000 deaths and over 1 million people were left homeless.
==Culture and literature==The Indian Ocean is known as Ratnakara in the ancient Sanskrit literature.

Swedish kings began to expand the Swedish-controlled territory in Finland, creating conflicts with the Rus who no longer had any connection with Sweden.
Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the means of exchange.
;The Plague in SwedenIn the middle of 14th century, Sweden was struck by the Black Death.
In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson, and in 1397 Queen Margaret I of Denmark effected the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the Kalmar Union.
During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states.
In the middle of the 17th century Sweden was the third-largest country in Europe by land area, only surpassed by Russia and Spain.
The foundation of Sweden's success during this period is credited to Gustav I's major changes on the Swedish economy in the 16th century, and his introduction of Protestantism.
After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the Swedish economy had deteriorated.
Sweden's largest threat at this time, Russia, had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training.
After the success of invading Poland, Charles decided to make an attempt at invading Russia, but this ended in a decisive Russian victory at the Battle of Poltava in 1709.
With Sweden's lost influence, Russia emerged as an empire and became one of Europe's dominant nations.
As the war finally ended in 1721, Sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from the area of present-day Sweden and 50,000 from the Finnish part of Sweden.
In the 18th century, Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with the loss in 1809 of eastern Sweden to Russia, which became the highly autonomous Grand Principality of Finland in Imperial Russia.
He launched a military campaign against Norway on 27 July 1814, ending in the Convention of Moss, which forced Norway into a personal union with Sweden under the Swedish crown, which lasted until 1905.
The 1814 campaign was the last time Sweden was at war.
Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled.
In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in Chicago than in Gothenburg (Sweden's second largest city).
Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe, the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in Swedish politics, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party).
Strong grassroots movements sprung up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century (trade unions, temperance groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles.
In 1889 The Swedish Social Democratic Party was founded.
===World War II===As in the first world war, Sweden remained officially neutral during World War II, although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed.
Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades.
The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest Germany, and therefore made some concessions.
Between 1970 and 1990 the overall tax burden rose by over 10%, and the growth was low compared to other countries in Western Europe.
Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995.
Among others, Swedish companies export weapons that were used by the American military in Iraq.
Sweden held the chair of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December 2009.
The lowest elevation in Sweden is in the bay of Lake Hammarsjön, near Kristianstad, at below sea level.
While these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose, they play an important role in people's self-identity.
About 15% of Sweden lies north of the Arctic Circle.
Vänern is the third largest in Europe, after Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega in Russia.
However, Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude, and even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the Gulf Stream.
For example, central and southern Sweden has much warmer winters than many parts of Russia, Canada, and the northern United States.
North of the Arctic Circle, the sun never sets for part of each summer, and it never rises for part of each winter.
In the capital, Stockholm, daylight lasts for more than 18 hours in late June but only around 6 hours in late December.
Sweden receives between 1,100 and 1,900 hours of sunshine annually.
The south-western part of the country receives more precipitation, between , and some mountain areas in the north are estimated to receive up to .
General elections are held every four years, on the second Sunday of September.
In the first case, Sweden was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by Tacitus, but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way.
This title was used up until 1973.

Before a case can be decided by the Supreme Court, leave to appeal must be obtained, and with few exceptions, leave to appeal can be granted only when the case is of interest as a precedent.
The Supreme Court consists of 16 Justices (), appointed by the Government, but the court as an institution is independent of the Riksdag, and the Government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court.
Sweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the Swedish campaign against Norway in 1814.
During World War II Sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers.
At the same time, the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the Western bloc, especially in the realm of intelligence exchange.
Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for NATO.
Beginning in the late 1960s, Sweden attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations.
It involved itself significantly in international peace efforts, especially through the United Nations, and in support to the Third World.
The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union.
Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the European Union, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co-operation.
The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peace support forces abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to refocus on the defence of Sweden in the event of war.
The armed forces are divided into Army, Air Force and Navy.
Until the end of the Cold War, nearly all males reaching the age of military service were conscripted.
All soldiers serving abroad must by law be volunteers.
In 1975 the total number of conscripts was 45,000.
By 2003 it was down to 15,000.
The total forces gathered would consist of about 60,000 men.
This could be compared with the 1980s before the fall of the Soviet Union, when Sweden could gather up to 1,000,000 men.
GDP per-hour-worked is growing 2.5% per year for the economy as a whole and the trade-terms-balanced productivity growth is 2%.
Sweden is a world leader in privatised pensions and pension funding problems are relatively small compared to many other Western European countries.
Tax income-financed employment represents a third of the Swedish workforce, a substantially higher proportion than in most other countries.
According to the book "The Flight of the Creative Class" by the US economist Professor Richard Florida of the University of Toronto, Sweden is ranked as having the best creativity in Europe for business and is predicted to become a talent magnet for the world's most purposeful workers.
In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 TWh, electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and nuclear power delivered 65 TWh (47%).
The 1973 oil crisis strengthened Sweden's commitment to decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels.
The use of nuclear power has been limited, however.
Among other things, the accident of Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station (United States) prompted the Riksdag to ban new nuclear plants.
In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power.
Politicians have made announcements about oil phase-out in Sweden, decrease of nuclear power, and multi-billion dollar investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency.
The country has for many years pursued a strategy of indirect taxation as an instrument of environmental policy, including energy taxes in general and carbon dioxide taxes in particular.

The largest airports include Stockholm–Arlanda Airport (16.1 million passengers in 2009) north of Stockholm, Göteborg–Landvetter Airport (4.3 million passengers in 2008), and Stockholm–Skavsta Airport (2.0 million passengers).
From the mid-1990s until today Sweden's economic growth has once again accelerated and has been higher than in most other industrialised countries (including the US) during the last 15 years.
Since the 1930s, the agricultural sector had been subject to price controls.
As a result, food prices fell somewhat.
Since the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of GDP) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries.
Public sector spending amounts to 53% of the GDP.
State and municipal employees total around a third of the workforce, much more than in most Western countries.
Only Denmark has a larger public sector (38% of Danish workforce).
Sweden has a relatively high amount of sick leave per worker in OECD: the average worker loses 24 days due to sickness.
In December 2008, the number employed in the 16–64 age group was 75.0%.

Most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages.
Some Danish and Norwegian is at times also taught as part of Swedish courses for native speakers.
In 2000 the Church of Sweden was separated from the state and Sweden ceased to have any official church.
The reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that, until 1996, children automatically became members at birth if at least one of the parents was a member.
In a Eurostat survey, 23% of Swedish citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", whereas 53% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 23% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force".
===Health===Healthcare in Sweden is similar in quality to other developed nations.
A person seeking care first contacts a clinic for a doctor's appointment, and may then be referred to a specialist by the clinic physician, who may in turn recommend either in-patient or out-patient treatment, or an elective care option.
The health care is governed by the 21 landsting of Sweden and is mainly funded by taxes, with nominal fees for patients.

ABBA was one of the first internationally well known popular music bands from Sweden, and still ranks among the most prominent bands in the world, with about 370 million records sold.
With ABBA, Sweden entered into a new era, in which Swedish pop music gained international prominence.
===Architecture===Before the 13th century almost all buildings were made of timber, but a shift began towards stone.
Early Swedish stone buildings are the Romanesque churches on the country side.
As so happens, many of them were built in Scania and are in effect Danish churches.
This would include the magnificent Lund Cathedral from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in Dalby, but also many early Gothic churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malmö and Helsingborg.
Cathedrals in other parts of Sweden were also built as seats of Sweden's bishops.
The Skara Cathedral is of bricks from the 14th century, and the Uppsala Cathedral in the 15th.
In 1230 the foundations of the Linköping Cathedral were made, the material was there limestone, but the building took some 250 years to finish.
Among older structures are also some significant fortresses and other historical buildings such as at Borgholm Castle, Halltorps Manor and Eketorp fortress on the island Öland, the Nyköping fortress and the Visby ring wall.
Some of the more magnificent include the Kalmar fortress, the Gripsholm Castle and the one at Vadstena.

It was followed by Kanal 5 in 1989 (then known as Nordic Channel) and TV4 in 1990.
In 1991 the government announced it would begin taking applications from private television companies wishing to broadcast on the terrestrial network.
TV4, which had previously been broadcasting via satellite, was granted a permit and began its terrestrial broadcasts in 1992, becoming the first private channel to broadcast television content from within the country.
Therefore there are only a few texts in the Old Swedish from that period.
The early 20th century continued to produce notable authors, such as Selma Lagerlöf, (Nobel laureate 1909), Verner von Heidenstam (Nobel laureate 1916) and Pär Lagerkvist (Nobel laureate 1951).
6 June is the National Day of Sweden and has since 2005 been a public holiday.
These companies, however, are composed largely of buyers who import fashionable goods from throughout Europe and America, continuing the trend of Swedish business toward multinational economic dependency like many of its neighbours.

Good dribblers (or "ball handlers") tend to bounce the ball low to the ground, reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand, making it more difficult for the defender to "steal" the ball.
==History==Soon after publishing the special theory of relativity in 1905, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework.
After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations.
The Einstein field equations are nonlinear and very difficult to solve.
This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes.
During that period, general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories.
George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician and businessman who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009, and the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000.

However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the Liberal Revolution of 1820, which started in Porto, demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.
Thus he returned to Portugal but left his son Pedro in charge of Brazil.
When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared Brazil's independence from Portugal.
This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of Mozambique and Angola (most of present-day Zimbabwe and Zambia), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its "Pink Map", which clashed with British aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway.
Portugal was one of only five European countries to remain neutral in World War II.
The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the Indian subcontinent.

Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years.
Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cancer of the cervix and the prostate are more frequent.
Portugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.
Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at the household level complement other data on health status and the use of services.
Only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004).
These include the Belém Cultural Centre in Lisbon, Serralves Foundation and the Casa da Música, both in Porto, as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls that were built or renovated in many municipalities across the country.
Out of the summer season, Portugal has a large number of festivals, designed more to an urban audience, like Flowfest or Hip Hop Porto.
There is also the student festivals of "Queima das Fitas" are major events in a number of cities across Portugal.
In equestrian sports, Portugal won the only Horseball-Pato World Championship (in 2006), achieved the third position in the First Horseball World Cup (organized in Ponte de Lima, Portugal, in 2008), and has achieved several victories in the European Working Equitation Championship.

Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation.
Approximately 61.3% of the population practice Islam, 19.8% practice Buddhism, 9.2% Christianity, 6.3% Hinduism and 1.3% practice Confucianism, Taoism and other traditional Chinese religions.
The nation's philosophy of defence is one of diplomacy and deterrence.
This principle translates into the culture, involving all citizens in the country's defence.
The government spends 4.9% of the country's GDP on the military, and one out of every four dollars of government spending is spent on defence.
This force was considered too small to provide effective security for the new country, so the development of the military became a priority.
Britain pulled its military out of Singapore in October 1971, leaving behind only a small British, Australian and New Zealand force as a token military presence.
The last British soldier left Singapore in March 1976.
New Zealand troops were the last to leave, in 1989.
A great deal of initial support came from Israel, a country that is not recognised by neighbouring Muslim-majority nations of Malaysia, Indonesia or Brunei.
The main fear after independence was an invasion by Malaysia.
Singapore still maintains strong security ties with Israel and is one of the biggest buyers of Israeli arms and weapons systems.
The MATADOR is one example of recent Singapore-Israeli collaboration.
The SAF is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues, in both conventional and unconventional warfare.
The geographic restrictions of Singapore mean that the SAF must plan to fully repulse an attack, as they can not fall back and re-group.
The small size of the population has also affected the way the SAF has been designed, with a small active force but a large number of reserves.
Singapore has conscription for all able-bodied males at age 18, except those with a criminal record or who can prove that their loss would bring hardship to their families.
Though not required to perform military service, the number of women in the SAF has been increasing: since 1989 they have been allowed to fill military vocations formerly reserved for men.
Before induction into a specific branch of the armed forces, recruits undergo at least 9 weeks of basic military training.
Because of the scarcity of open land on the main island, training involving activities such as live firing and amphibious warfare is often carried out on smaller islands, typically barred to civilian access.
This also avoids risk to the main island and the city.
Training is also held in about a dozen other countries.
In general, military exercises are held with foreign forces once or twice per week.
The RSAF also has a few overseas detachments in the United States, in San Diego, California, Marana, Arizona, Grand Prairie, Texas and Luke Air Force Base, among others.
The SAF has sent forces to assist in operations outside the country, in areas such as Iraq and Afghanistan, in both military and civilian roles.
In the region, it has helped stabilise East Timor and has provided aid to Aceh in Indonesia following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.
The SAF also helped in relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina.
Singapore is part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements, a military alliance with Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
All institutions, private and public, must be registered with the Ministry of Education.
The curriculum is focused on the development of English, the mother tongue, mathematics, and science.
The basic coursework breakdown is the same as in the primary level, although classes are much more specialised.
Some schools have a degree of freedom in their curriculum and are known as autonomous schools.
These exist from the secondary education level and up.
National examinations are standardised across all schools, with a test taken after each stage.
After the first six years of education, students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), which determines their placement at secondary school.
At the end of the secondary stage, GCE "O"-Level exams are taken; at the end of the following pre-university stage, the GCE "A"-Level exams are taken.
=== Media ===Companies linked to the government control much of the domestic media in Singapore.
There are a total of seven free-to-air TV channels offered by Mediacorp.
The channels are Channel 5 (English channel), Channel News Asia (English channel), Okto (English channel), Channel 8 (Chinese channel), Channel U (Chinese channel), Suria (Malay channel) and Vasantham (Indian channel).
Singapore's media industry has sometimes been criticised for being too regulated and lacking in freedom by human rights groups such as Freedom House.
In 2010, Reporters Without Borders, a France-based international non-governmental organisation, ranked Singapore 136 out of 178 in its Press Freedom Index, just below Mexico.
There are 3.4 million users of the internet in Singapore, one of the highest internet penetration rates in the world.
As the block covers only home internet access, users may still visit the blocked websites from their office computers.
==Culture and society==The civil society in Pakistan is largely hierarchical, emphasising local cultural etiquettes and traditional Islamic values that govern personal and political life.
The basic family unit is the extended family, although there has been a growing trend towards nuclear families for socio-economic reasons.
The middle class has increased to around 35 million and the upper and upper-middle classes to around 17 million in recent decades, and power is shifting from rural landowners to the urbanised elites.
Pakistanis wear clothes range from exquisite colors and designs to the type of fabric (silk, chiffon, cotton, etc).
The Pakistan Fashion Design Council based in Lahore organizes "Fashion Week" and Fashion Pakistan based in Karachi organizes fashion shows in that city.
Pakistan's first fashion week was held in November 2009.
===Media and entertainment===The private print media, state-owned Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV) and Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) for radio were the dominant media outlets until the start of the 21st century.
In addition to the national entertainment and news channels, foreign television channels and films are also on air.
The arrival of Afghan refugees in the western provinces has stimulated interest in Pashto music, although there has been intolerance of it in some places.
Pakistan has some of the world's modern vibrant and open media.
Pakistani media has also played a vital role in exposing corruption.
Furthermore, 50.0% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.
Immigration, both from within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors that has contributed to urbanisation in Pakistan.
One analysis of the national census held in 1998 highlighted the significance of the Partition of India in the 1940s in the context of understanding urban change in Pakistan.
During the independence period, Muslim Muhajirs from India migrated in large numbers and shifted their domicile to Pakistan, especially to the port city of Karachi, which is today the largest metropolis in Pakistan.
Migration from other countries, mainly those in the neighbourhood, has further catalysed the process of urbanisation in Pakistani cities.
Of particular interest is migration that occurred in the aftermath of the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, in the form of stranded Biharis who were relocated to Pakistan.
The conflict in Afghanistan also forced millions of Afghan refugees into Pakistan, particularly in the northwestern regions.
The Overseas Pakistani Division (OPD) was created in September 2004 within the Ministry of Labour (MoL), and has since recognized the importance of overseas Pakistanis and their contribution to the nation's economy.
Together with Community Welfare Attaches (CWAs) and the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF), the OPD is improving the welfare of Pakistanis who reside abroad.
The division aims to provide better services through improved facilities at airports, and suitable schemes for housing, education and health care—its largest effort is the facilitation of the rehabilitation of returning overseas Pakistanis.
Before the 19th century , it consisted mainly of lyric and religious poetry, mystical and folkloric works.
Prose fiction is now very popular.
Sufi poets Shah Abdul Latif, Bulleh Shah, Mian Muhammad Bakhsh and Khawaja Farid are very popular in Pakistan.
With the beginning of the Indus civilisation around the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, an advanced urban culture developed for the first time in the region, with large buildings, some of which survive to this day.
The rise of Buddhism and the Persian and Greek influence led to the development of the Greco-Buddhist style, starting from the 1st century CE.
The high point of this era was reached at the peak of the Gandhara style.
The arrival of Islam in today's Pakistan meant a sudden end of Buddhist architecture in the area and a smooth transition to the predominantly pictureless Islamic architecture.
Lahore, occasional residence of Mughal rulers, exhibits many important buildings from the empire.
In the British colonial period, predominantly functional buildings of the Indo-European representative style developed from a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components.
Pakistan has a greater variety of meat dishes compared to the rest of the sub-continent and most of those dishes have their roots in British, Central Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine.
Rice is also common; it is served plain or fried with spices and is also used in sweet dishes.
Lassi is a traditional drink in the Punjab region.
Black tea with milk and sugar is popular throughout Pakistan and is taken daily by most of the population.
Sohan Halwa is a very popular sweet dish of southern region of Punjab province and is enjoyed all over Pakistan.
Field Hockey is the national sport of Pakistan; it has won three Gold medallions in the Olympic Games held in 1960, 1968, and 1984.
Pakistan has also won the Hockey World Cup a record four times held in 1971, 1978, 1982, and in 1994.
Cricket, however, is the most popular game across the country.
Pakistan were runners-up in the inaugural World Twenty20 (2007) in South Africa and won the World Twenty20 in England in 2009.
No teams have toured Pakistan since March 2009, when militants attacked the touring Sri Lanka's Cricket team.
He won 34 International Gold, 15 International Silver and 12 Bronze Medals for Pakistan.
In squash, world-class players such as Jahangir Khan, widely considered to be the greatest player in the sport's history, and Jansher Khan won the World Open Squash Championship several times during their careers.
Jahangir Khan also won the British Open a record ten times.
Pakistan has competed many times at the Olympics in field hockey, boxing, athletics, swimming, and shooting.
Pakistan's Olympic medal tally stands at 10 of which 8 were earned in hockey.
The Commonwealth Games and Asian Games medal tallies stand at 65 and 160 respectively.
At national level, polo is popular, with regular national events in different parts of the country.

The Philippines (; ), officially known as the Republic of the Philippines (), is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean.
Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands.
In the 19th century, Philippine ports opened to world trade and shifts started occurring within Philippine society.
The ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands.
Rizal was eventually executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion.
Bonifacio and the Katipunan started the Philippine Revolution in 1896.
In 1898, the Spanish–American War began in Cuba and reached the Philippines.
A compensation of 20 million US dollars was paid to Spain according to the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris.
Carlos P. Romulo was a former President of the United Nations General Assembly.
The Philippines is an active member of the East Asia Summit (EAS), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Latin Union, the Group of 24, and the Non-Aligned Movement.
The island of Borneo is located a few hundred kilometers southwest and Taiwan is located directly to the north.
The longest river is the Cagayan River in northern Luzon.
The Benham Plateau to the east in the Philippine Sea is an undersea region active in tectonic subduction.
The last major earthquake was the 1990 Luzon earthquake.
There are many active volcanoes such as the Mayon Volcano, Mount Pinatubo, and Taal Volcano.
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 produced the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century.
Due to the volcanic nature of the islands, mineral deposits are abundant.
The country is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa and one of the largest copper deposits in the world.
Despite this, poor management, high population density, and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely untapped.
It is one of the ten most biologically megadiverse countries and is at or near the top in terms of biodiversity per unit area.
Deforestation, often the result of illegal logging, is an acute problem in the Philippines.
Forest cover declined from 70% of the country's total land area in 1900 to about 18.3% in 1999.
According to Conservation International, "the country is one of the few nations that is, in its entirety, both a hotspot and a megadiversity country, placing it among the top priority hotspots for global conservation.
The southwest monsoon (from May to October) is known as the Habagat, and the dry winds of the northeast monsoon (from November to April), the Amihan.
In considering temperature, location in terms of latitude and longitude is not a significant factor.
Whether in the extreme north, south, east, or west of the country, temperatures at sea level tend to be in the same range.
Of the country's total labor force of around 40.813 Million, the agricultural sector employs close to 32% of the labor force, and accounts for 14% of GDP.
The industrial sector employs around 14% of the workforce and accounts for 30% of GDP.
Meanwhile the 47% of workers involved in the services sector are responsible for 56% of GDP.
The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis affected the economy, resulting in a lingering decline of the value of the peso and falls in the stock market.
This was largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the government, partly as a result of decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth.
There have been signs of progress since.
In 2004, the economy experienced 6.4% GDP growth and 7.1% in 2007, its fastest pace of growth in three decades.
Average annual GDP growth per capita for the period 1966–2007 still stands at 1.45% in comparison to an average of 5.96% for the East Asia and the Pacific region as a whole.
The population's median age is 22.7 years with 60.9% aged from 15 to 64 years old.
Life expectancy at birth is 71.94 years, 75.03 years for females and 68.99 years for males.
Most native languages are part of the Philippine branch of the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which is itself a branch of the Austronesian language family.
Some have migrated into urban and rural areas in different parts of the country.
As of 2009, 67.1% of healthcare came from private expenditures while 32.9% was from government.
External resources accounted for 2.9% of the total.
Health expenditures represented about 6.1% of total government spending.
There are an estimated 90,370 physicians or 1 per every 833 people, 480,910 nurses, 43,220 dentists, and 1 hospital bed per every 769 people.
Retention of skilled practitioners is a problem.
70% of nursing graduates go overseas to work.
The country is the biggest supplier of nurses.
In 2001 there were about 1,700 hospitals, of which about 40% were government-run and 60% private.
Cardiovascular diseases account for more than 25% of all deaths.
The names of many streets, towns, and provinces are also in Spanish.
Other Philippine languages, including various Visayan languages are also used, especially in radio due to its ability to reach remote rural locations that might otherwise not be serviced by other kinds of media.
Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California.
He and his wife, Pat Nixon, moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942.
He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II.
Although Nixon initially escalated the war in Vietnam, he subsequently ended the US involvement in 1973.
In 2009, he was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti, and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake he teamed with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund.
Colorado has a flat 4.63% income tax, regardless of income level.
These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.
*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts.
In 1815, it was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.
A member of the BRIC group, Brazil until 2010 had one of the world's fastest growing major economies, with its economic reforms giving the country new international recognition and influence.
Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, CPLP, Latin Union, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the Organization of American States, Mercosul and the Union of South American Nations.
By the end of the 17th century, sugarcane exports began to decline, and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy, fostering a Brazilian Gold Rush, attracting thousands of new settlers to Brazil, from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the World, which in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers.
Portuguese expeditions known as Bandeiras gradually advanced the Portugal colonial original frontiers in South America to approximately the current Brazilian borders.
In this era other European powers tried to colonize parts of Brazil, in incursions that the Portuguese had to fight, notably the French in Rio during the 1560s, in Maranhão during the 1610s, and the Dutch in Bahia and Pernambuco, during the Dutch–Portuguese War, after the end of Iberian Union.
===United Kingdom with Portugal===In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental Portugal, causing Prince Regent João, in the name of Queen Maria I, to move the royal court from Lisbon to Brazil.
There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local stock exchanges, a National Bank, and ended the monopoly of the colony trade with Portugal, opening it to other nations.
In 1815, in order to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for the past six years, the Crown established the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state.
The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822.
With the last Portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 March 1824, Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825.
This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the Praieira revolt, was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the premature coronation of Pedro II in 1841.
During the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery.
The Atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850, as a result of the British' Aberdeen Act, but only in May 1888 after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country, was the institution formally abolished.
The foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the Southern Cone with which Brazil has borders.
Long after the Cisplatine War that resulted in independence for Uruguay, Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro II.
These were the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the devastating Paraguayan War, the largest war effort in Brazilian history.
On 15 November 1889, worn out by years of economic stagnation, in attrition with the majority of Army officers, as well as with rural and financial elites (for different reasons), the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.
Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power".
In 1894, following the unfoldings of two severe crises, an economic along with a military one, the republican civilians rose to power.
In the 1930s, three major attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power occurred: in the second half of 1932, in November 1935, and in May 1938.
In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period, was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations, after its involvement in World War I.
In World War II Brazil remained neutral until August 1942, when the country entered on the allied side, after suffering retaliations undertaken by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, due to the country having severed diplomatic relations with them in the wake of the Pan-American Conference.
Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.
The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably, but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Brasília, inaugurated in 1960.
Despite its brutality, like other totalitarian regimes in history, due to an economic boom, known as an "economic miracle", the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the early 1970s.
Slowly however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that have not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas, plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals Geisel and Golbery.
With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began its slow return to democracy, which would be completed during the 1980s.
In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful Plano Real, that, after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally granted stability to the Brazilian economy, leading Cardoso to be elected that year, and again in 1998.
The peaceful transition of power from Fernando Henrique to his main opposition leader, Luís Inácio Lula da Silva, who was elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006, proved that Brazil had finally succeeded in achieving its long-sought political stability.
Lula was succeeded in 2011 by the current president, Dilma Rousseff, the country's first woman president and as such one of the most powerful women in the world.
For days, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in several cities to protest.
==Demographics==The population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million (), with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1 and 83.75% of the population defined as urban.
From 1880 to 1930, 4 million Europeans arrived.
Brazil's population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970, because of a decline in the mortality rate, even though the birth rate underwent a slight decline.
In the 1940s the annual population growth rate was 2.4%, rising to 3.0% in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9% in the 1960s, as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years and to 72.6 years in 2007.
It has been steadily falling since the 1960s, from 3.04% per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05% in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of –0.29% by 2050 thus completing the demographic transition.
In 2008, the illiteracy rate was 11.48% and among the youth (ages 15–19) 1.74%.
It was highest (20.30%) in the Northeast, which had a large proportion of rural poor.
Illiteracy was high (24.18%) among the rural population and lower (9.05%) among the urban population.
===Race and ethnicity===According to the National Research by Household Sample (PNAD) of 2008, 48.43% of the population (about 92 million) described themselves as White; 43.80% (about 83 million) as Pardo (brown), 6.84% (about 13 million) as Black; 0.58% (about 1.1 million) as Asian; and 0.28% (about 536 thousand) as Amerindian (officially called "indígena", Indigenous), while 0.07% (about 130 thousand) did not declare their race.
From the 19th century, Brazil opened its borders to immigration.
About five million people from over 60 countries migrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1972, most of them of Portuguese, Italian, Spaniard, German, Ukrainian, Polish, Jewish, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Middle Eastern origin.
===Religion===Religion in Brazil formed from the meeting of the Catholic Church with the religious traditions of enslaved African peoples and indigenous peoples.
This confluence of faiths during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of Brazilian Catholicism, characterized by traditional Portuguese festivities, and in some instances, Allan Kardec's Spiritism (most Brazilian Spiritists are also Christians).
Catholicism is the country's predominant faith.
Brazil has the world's largest Catholic population.
According to the 2000 Demographic Census (the PNAD survey does not inquire about religion), 73.57% of the population followed Catholicism; 15.41% Protestantism; 1.33% Kardecist spiritism; 1.22% other Christian denominations; 0.31% Afro-Brazilian religions; 0.13% Buddhism; 0.05% Judaism; 0.02% Islam; 0.01% Amerindian religions; 0.59% other religions, undeclared or undetermined; while 7.35% have no religion.
After Protestantism, individuals professing no religion are also a significant group, exceeding 7% of the population in the 2000 census.
Teresina, Fortaleza, and Florianópolis were the most Roman Catholic in the country.
The national beverage is coffee and cachaça is Brazil's native liquor.
Cachaça is distilled from sugar cane and is the main ingredient in the national cocktail, Caipirinha.
An average meal consists mostly of rice and beans with beef and salad.
Often, it's mixed with cassava flour (farofa).
Fried potatoes, fried cassava, fried banana, fried meat and fried cheese are very often eaten in lunch and served in most typical restaurants.
Popular snacks are pastel (a pastry); coxinha (chicken croquete); pão de queijo (cheese bread and cassava flour / tapioca); pamonha (corn and milk paste); esfirra (Lebanese pastry); kibbeh (from Arabic cuisine); empanada (pastry) and empada, little salt pies filled with shrimps or heart of palm.
Brazil has a variety of candies such as brigadeiros (chocolate fudge balls), cocada (a coconut sweet), beijinhos (coconut truffles and clove) and romeu e julieta (cheese with a guava jam known as goiabada).
Peanuts are used to make paçoca, rapadura and pé-de-moleque.

The capital and largest city is Bangkok, which is Thailand's political, commercial, industrial, and cultural hub.
Thailand experienced rapid economic growth between 1985 and 1996, becoming a newly industrialised country and a major exporter.
It is bordered on the north by the United States; on the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; on the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and on the east by the Gulf of Mexico.
The latter led to the Mexican Revolution in 1910, which culminated with the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution and the emergence of the country's current political system.
In addition, Mexico was the first Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD (since 1994), and considered an upper-middle income country by the World Bank.
Mexico ranks sixth in the world and first in the Americas by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites with 32, and in 2010 was the tenth most visited country in the world with 22.5 million international arrivals per year.
q233After New Spain won independence from Spain, it was decided that the new country would be named after its capital, Mexico City, which was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient Mexica capital of Mexico-Tenochtitlan.
The system of interconnected lakes, of which Texcoco formed the center, had the form of a rabbit, which the Mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the Moon.
This led to the use of the variant Méjico in many publications in Spanish, most notably in Spain, whereas in Mexico and most other Spanish–speaking countries México was the preferred spelling.
In recent years the Real Academia Española, which regulates the Spanish language, determined that both variants are acceptable in Spanish but that the normative recommended spelling is México.
In English, the 'x' in Mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound, but the consonant cluster .
The official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed.
The phrase , "Mexican Republic", was used in the 1836 Constitutional Laws.
Teotihuacan, with a population of more than 150,000 people, had some of the largest pyramidal structures in the pre-Columbian Americas.
The territory became part of the Spanish Empire under the name of New Spain.
Much of the identity, traditions and architecture of Mexico were created during the colonial period.
Morelos was captured and executed on December 22, 1815.
A revolt against him in 1823 established the United Mexican States.
In 1824, a Republican Constitution was drafted and Guadalupe Victoria became the first president of the newly born country.
When he suspended the 1824 Constitution, civil war spread across the country, and three new governments declared independence: the Republic of Texas, the Republic of the Rio Grande and the Republic of Yucatán.
Texas successfully achieved independence and joined the United States.
A border dispute led to the Mexican-American War, which began in 1846 and lasted for two years; the War was settled via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which forced Mexico to give up over half of its land to the U.S., including Alta California, New Mexico, and the disputed parts of Texas.
That event re-ignited the civil war, involving figures such as Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata, who formed their own forces.
It is estimated that the war killed 900,000 of the 1910 population of 15 million.
That year, oil prices plunged, interest rates soared, and the government defaulted on its debt.
President Miguel de la Madrid resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked inflation.
In 2000, after 71 years, the PRI lost a presidential election to Vicente Fox of the opposition National Action Party (PAN).
The constitution establishes three levels of government: the federal Union, the state governments and the municipal governments.
They also have their own civil and judicial codes.
The principles of the foreign policy are constitutionally recognized in the Article 89, Section 10, which include: respect for international law and legal equality of states, their sovereignty and independence, non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries, peaceful resolution of conflicts, and promotion of collective security through active participation in international organizations.
Mexico is one of the founding members of several international organizations, most notably the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the OPANAL and the Rio Group.
Mexico is considered a regional power hence its presence in major economic groups such as the G8+5 and the G-20.
In addition, since the 1990s Mexico has sought a reform of the United Nations Security Council and its working methods with the support of Canada, Italy, Pakistan and other nine countries, which form a group informally called the Coffee Club.
The Mexican Armed Forces maintain significant infrastructure, including facilities for design, research, and testing of weapons, vehicles, aircraft, naval vessels, defense systems and electronics; military industry manufacturing centers for building such systems, and advanced naval dockyards that build heavy military vessels and advanced missile technologies.
Mexico has the capabilities to manufacture nuclear weapons, but abandoned this possibility with the Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1968 and pledged to only use its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
In 1970, Mexico's national institute for nuclear research successfully refined weapons grade uranium which is used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons but in April 2010, Mexico agreed to turn over its weapons grade uranium to the United States.
Almost all of Mexico lies in the North American Plate, with small parts of the Baja California peninsula on the Pacific and Cocos Plates.
Geophysically, some geographers include the territory east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (around 12% of the total) within Central America.
Geopolitically, however, Mexico is entirely considered part of North America, along with Canada and the United States.
On its north, Mexico shares a border with the United States.
As such, the majority of the Mexican central and northern territories are located at high altitudes, and the highest elevations are found at the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt: Pico de Orizaba (), Popocatepetl () and Iztaccihuatl () and the Nevado de Toluca ().
Temperatures here remain high throughout the year, with only a difference between winter and summer median temperatures.
Many large cities in Mexico are located in the Valley of Mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes generally above .
Many parts of Mexico, particularly the north, have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than of annual precipitation.
For example, many cities in the north like Monterrey, Hermosillo, and Mexicali experience temperatures of or more in summer.
===Biodiversity===Mexico is one of the 18 megadiverse countries of the world.
Mexico ranks first in biodiversity in reptiles with 707 known species, second in mammals with 438 species, fourth in amphibians with 290 species, and fourth in flora, with 26,000 different species.
Mexico is also considered the second country in the world in ecosystems and fourth in overall species.
Approximately 2,500 species are protected by Mexican legislations.
, Mexico had the second fastest rate of deforestation in the world, second only to Brazil.
GDP annual average growth for the period of 1995–2002 was 5.1%.
From the late 1990s onwards, the majority of the population has been part of the growing middle class.
Nevertheless, according to Goldman Sachs, by 2050 Mexico will have the 5th largest economy in the world.
The industry produces technologically complex components and engages in some research and development activities.
Other players in the domestic industry are Axtel and Maxcom.
It offers broadcast, telephone and telecommunication services to 37 countries in the Americas, from Canada to Argentina.
The use of radio, television, and Internet in Mexico is prevalent.
Many scientific institutes and new institutes of higher learning, such as National Polytechnic Institute (founded in 1936), were established during the first half of the 20th century.
In 1959, the Mexican Academy of Sciences was created to coordinate scientific efforts between academics.
Molina, an alumnus of UNAM, became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science.
The core part of Mexican national identity is formed on the basis of a synthesis of European culture with Indigenous cultures in a process known as mestizaje, alluding to the mixed biological origins of the majority of Mexicans.
According to the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples, there were 10.1 million Mexicans who spoke an indigenous language and claimed indigenous heritage, representing 9.8% of the total population.
Mexico is home to the largest number of U.S. citizens abroad (estimated at one million in 1999).
The Argentine community is considered to be the second-largest foreign community in the country (estimated somewhere between 30,000 and 150,000).
In October 2008, Mexico agreed to deport Cubans using the country as an entry point to the US.
Small numbers of illegal immigrants come from Ecuador, Cuba, China, South Africa, and Pakistan.
Mexico is home to a large number of indigenous languages, spoken by some 5.4% of the population – 1.2% of the population are monolingual speakers of an indigenous language.
The indigenous languages with most speakers are Nahuatl, spoken by approximately 1.45 million people, Yukatek Maya spoken by some 750,000 people and the Mixtec and Zapotec languages each spoken by more than 400,000 people.
Since the promulgation of the Law of Indigenous Linguistic Rights in 2003, these languages have had status as national languages, with equal validity with Spanish in all the areas and contexts in which they are spoken.
In addition to the indigenous languages, other minority languages are spoken by immigrant populations, such as the 80,000 German-speaking Mennonites in Mexico, and 5,000 the Chipilo dialect of the Venetian language spoken in Chipilo, Puebla.
172,891 (or less than 0.2% of the total) belonged to other, non-Christian religions; 4.7% declared having no religion; 2.7% were unspecified.
The 92,924,489 Catholics of Mexico constitute in absolute terms the second largest Catholic community in the world, after Brazil's.
47% percent of them attend church services weekly.
The feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, is celebrated on December 12 and is regarded by many Mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country.
The 2010 census reported 314,932 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, though the church in 2009 claimed to have over one million registered members.
According to the 2010 census, there are 67,476 Jews in Mexico.
Islam in Mexico is practiced by a small population in the city of Torreón, Coahuila, and there are an estimated 300 Muslims in the San Cristóbal de las Casas area in Chiapas.
After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President Díaz himself.
Mexican films were exported and exhibited in all of Latin America and Europe.
Maria Candelaria (1944) by Emilio Fernández, was one of the first films awarded a Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II.
Some states, through their state agencies in charge of culture and the arts—Ministry or Secretary or Institute or Council of Culture, in some cases Secretary of Education or the State University—sponsor the activities of a professional Symphony Orchestra or Philharmonic Orchestra so all citizens can have access to this artistic expression from the field of classical music.
===Sports===Mexico City hosted the XIX Olympic Games in 1968, making it the first Latin American city to do so.
It is commonly believed that football was introduced in Mexico by Cornish miners at the end of the 19th century.
Mexico's top clubs are América with 12 championships, Guadalajara with 11, and Toluca with 10.
Bullfighting is a popular sport in the country, and almost all large cities have bullrings.
Plaza México in Mexico City, is the largest bullring in the world, which seats 55,000 people.
Canada is a country in North America consisting of ten provinces and three territories.
Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean.
In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St. John's, Newfoundland, as the first North American English colony.
The Royal Proclamation of 1763 created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.
St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769.
It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there.
The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and Britain.
Following the war, large-scale immigration to Canada from Britain and Ireland began in 1815.
The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.
The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel.
This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).
British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871, while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.
In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain, and the 1931 Statute of Westminster affirmed Canada's independence.
On the advice of Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, King George VI declared war on Germany during World War II, seven days after Britain.
The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939.
The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union.
Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.
Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the current Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.
In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.
This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.
A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.
In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
As such, the Queen's representative, the Governor General of Canada (at present David Lloyd Johnston), carries out most of the federal royal duties in Canada.
General elections must be called by the governor general, either on the advice of the prime minister, within four years of the previous election, or if the government loses a confidence vote in the House.
The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.
The list of historical parties with elected representation is substantial.
These rights may include provision of services such as health care, and exemption from taxation.
The legal and policy framework within which Canada and First Nations operate was further formalized in 2005, through the First Nations–Federal Crown Political Accord.
The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led since 2000 by the Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin (the first female Chief Justice).
Its nine members are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice.
Canada's strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II.
Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.
Canada was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 and of NATO in 1949.
During the Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in co-operation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.
Canada joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in Windsor, Ontario, in June 2000 and the third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in April 2001.
In February 2007, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Russia announced their joint commitment to a $1.5-billion project to help develop vaccines for developing nations, and called on other countries to join them.
The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry.
Between October 2008 and October 2010, the Canadian labour market lost 162,000 full-time jobs and a total of 224,000 permanent jobs.
In addition, Canada's net foreign debt rose by $41 billion to $194 billion in the first quarter of 2010.
The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.
In common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age.
In 2006, the average age was 39.5 years; by 2011, it had risen to approximately 39.9 years.
According to the 2006 census, the country's largest self-reported ethnic origin is Canadian (accounting for 32% of the population), followed by English (21%), French (15.8%), Scottish (15.1%), Irish (13.9%), German (10.2%), Italian (4.6%), Chinese (4.3%), First Nations (4.0%), Ukrainian (3.9%), and Dutch (3.3%).
Another 16.2 percent of the population belonged to a non-aboriginal visible minority.
In 2006, the largest visible minority groups were South Asian (4.0%), Chinese (3.9%) and Black (2.5%).
Between 2001 and 2006, the visible minority population rose by 27.2 percent.
The leading sources of immigrants to Canada were China, the Philippines and India.
English and French are the first languages of 59.7 and 23.2 percent of the population respectively.
Approximately 98 percent of Canadians speak English or French: 57.8 percent speak English only, 22.1 percent speak French only, and 17.4 percent speak both.
The English and French official-language communities, defined by the first official language spoken, constitute 73.0 and 23.6 percent of the population respectively.
The 1977 Charter of the French Language established French as the official language of Quebec.
There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and through central and western Prince Edward Island.
Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English.
There are 11 Aboriginal language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct dialects.
Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut, and is one of three official languages in the territory.
In Quebec, cultural identity is strong, and many French-speaking commentators speak of a culture of Quebec that is distinct from English Canadian culture.
Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, and the legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.
A. J. Casson became part of the Group in 1926.
The text was originally only in French, before it was translated to English in 1906.
Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse.
He used multiple narrators two of which were inanimate objects.
The country is often referred to as "Africa in miniature" for its geological and cultural diversity.
The highest point is Mount Cameroon in the southwest, and the largest cities are Douala, Yaoundé, and Garoua.
Cameroon is home to over 200 different linguistic groups.
The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly makossa and bikutsi, and for its successful national football team.
After World War I, the territory was divided between France and Britain as League of Nations mandates.
The country was renamed the United Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984.
Nevertheless, large numbers of Cameroonians live in poverty as subsistence farmers.
Portuguese sailors reached the coast in 1472.
They noted an abundance of the ghost shrimp "Lepidophthalmus turneranus" in the Wouri River and named it ("Shrimp River"), which became "Cameroon" in English.
Over the following few centuries, European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples, and Christian missionaries pushed inland.
The northern part of Cameroon was an important part of the Arab slave trade network.
The script was developed by Sultan Ibrahim Njoya in 1896, and is taught in Cameroon by the Bamum Scripts and Archives Project.
The German Empire claimed the territory as the colony of Kamerun in 1884 and began a steady push inland.
With the defeat of Germany in World War I, Kamerun became a League of Nations mandate territory and was split into French and British Cameroons in 1919.
France integrated the economy of Cameroun with that of France and improved the infrastructure with capital investments, skilled workers, and continued forced labour.
The League of Nations mandates were converted into United Nations Trusteeships in 1946, and the question of independence became a pressing issue in French Cameroun.
In British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.
=== Independence (1960) ===On 1 January 1960 French Cameroun gained independence from France under President Ahmadou Ahidjo.
On 1 October 1961, the formerly British Southern Cameroons united with French Cameroun to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon.
Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971.
His political party, the Cameroon National Union (CNU), became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966 and in 1972, the federal system of government was abolished in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon, headed from Yaoundé.
The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.
Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor, Paul Biya.
An economic crisis took effect in the mid-1980s to late 1990s as a result of international economic conditions, drought, falling petroleum prices, and years of corruption, mismanagement, and cronyism.
Cameroon turned to foreign aid, cut government spending, and privatised industries.
In February 2008, Cameroon experienced its worst violence in 15 years when a transport union strike in Douala escalated into violent protests in 31 municipal areas.
The country's neighbours are Nigeria to the west; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo to the south.
==Proton in chemistry=====Atomic number===In chemistry, the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is known as the atomic number, which determines the chemical element to which the atom belongs.
For example, the atomic number of chlorine is 17; this means that each chlorine atom has 17 protons and that all atoms with 17 protons are chlorine atoms.
For example, the charges of the proton and antiproton must sum to exactly zero.
This equality has been tested to one part in .
The equality of their masses has also been tested to better than one part in .
The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton.
The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding.
A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but the same electrical fluid under different pressures.
Between 1838 and 1851, British natural philosopher Richard Laming developed the idea that an atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by subatomic particles that had unit electric charges.
After studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in 1874, Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney suggested that there existed a "single definite quantity of electricity", the charge of a monovalent ion.
In 1876, the German physicist Eugen Goldstein showed that the rays from this glow cast a shadow, and he dubbed the rays cathode rays.
He then showed that the luminescence rays appearing within the tube carried energy and moved from the cathode to the anode.
However, this produced a value that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.
In 1896, the British physicist J. J. Thomson, with his colleagues John S. Townsend and H. A. Wilson, performed experiments indicating that cathode rays really were unique particles, rather than waves, atoms or molecules as was believed earlier.
This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms.
This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a result of gravity.
This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1–150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%.
The electrons could move between these states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons at specific frequencies.
With this model Langmuir was able to qualitatively explain the chemical properties of all elements in the periodic table, which were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law.
To resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, in 1930 Dirac developed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles having negative energy, which was dubbed the Dirac sea.
The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst.
His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3 MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300 MeV.
In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70 MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric.
This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons, moving near the speed of light, through a magnetic field.
On the basis of Einstein's principle of mass–energy equivalence, this mass corresponds to a rest energy of 0.511 MeV.
Astronomical measurements show that the proton-to-electron mass ratio has held the same value for at least half the age of the universe, as is predicted by the Standard Model.
However, the electron is thought to be stable on theoretical grounds: the electron is the least massive particle with non-zero electric charge, so its decay would violate charge conservation.
When the absolute value of this function is squared, it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.
Electrons are identical particles because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties.
In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system.
In the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state.
This principle explains many of the properties of electrons.
The interaction with virtual particles also explains the small (about 0.1%) deviation of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron from the Bohr magneton (the anomalous magnetic moment).
When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field.
The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation.
Such interaction between the light and free electrons is called Thomson scattering or Linear Thomson scattering.
Charge is conserved during this reaction because the W boson also carries a charge, canceling out any net change during the transmutation.
If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion.
Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus.
===Conductivity===[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania cropped.jpg_right_thumb_alt=Four bolts of lightning strike the ground_A lightning discharge consists primarily of a flow of electrons.
(Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100 nm, so they can overlap each other.
The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, "c".
As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.
The effects of special relativity are based on a quantity known as the Lorentz factor, defined as formula_1 where "v" is the speed of the particle.
The kinetic energy "K"e of an electron moving with velocity "v" is::formula_2where "m"e is the mass of electron.
For the 51 GeV electron above, the wavelength is about , small enough to explore structures well below the size of an atomic nucleus.
==Formation==The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted scientific theory to explain the early stages in the evolution of the Universe.
For the first millisecond of the Big Bang, the temperatures were over 10 billion Kelvin and photons had mean energies over a million electronvolts.
Likewise, positron-electron pairs annihilated each other and emitted energetic photons:An equilibrium between electrons, positrons and photons was maintained during this phase of the evolution of the Universe.
Roughly one million years after the big bang, the first generation of stars began to form.
However, the process of stellar evolution can result in the synthesis of radioactive isotopes.
However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance.
Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.
The magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits, which, in 1980, was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant.
ARPES can be used to determine the direction, speed and scattering of electrons within the material.
==Plasma applications=====Particle beams===[[File:Nasa Shuttle Test Using Electron Beam full.jpg_right_thumb_alt=A violet beam from above produces a blue glow about a Space shuttle model_During a NASA wind tunnel test, a model of the Space Shuttle is targeted by a beam of electrons, simulating the effect of ionizing gases during re-entry.
For this reason, EBL is primarily used for the production of small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.
Electron therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5 cm for electron energies in the range 5–20 MeV.
The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency.
These devices may find manufacturing, communication and various medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.
Argentina stayed neutral during World War I.
A new military coup toppled the government, and Argentina declared war on the Axis Powers a month before the end of World War II in Europe.
However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year.
==Geography==With a mainland surface area of , Argentina is located in southern South America, sharing land borders with Chile across the Andes to the west; Bolivia and Paraguay to the north; Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east; and the Drake Passage to the south; for an overall land border length of .
The lowest point is Laguna del Carbón in the "San Julián Great Depression" Santa Cruz province ( below sea level, also the lowest point in the Southern and Western Hemispheres, and the seventh lowest point on Earth)The northernmost point is at the confluence of the Grande de San Juan and Río Mojinete rivers in Jujuy province; the southernmost is Cape San Pío in Tierra del Fuego province; the easternmost is northeast of Bernardo de Irigoyen, Misiones and the westernmost is within Los Glaciares National Park in Santa Cruz province.
* Sierras Pampeanas, a series of medium-height mountain chains located in the center.

Seats are apportioned among the provinces by population every tenth year.
At least one-third of the candidates presented by the parties must be women.
In 2012 Argentina was elected again to a two-year non-permanent position on the United Nations Security Council and is participating in major peacekeeping operations in Haiti, Cyprus, Western Sahara and the Middle East.
A prominent Latin American and Southern Cone regional power, Argentina co-founded OEI, CELAC and UNASUR, of which the former president Néstor Kirchner was first Secretary General.
:Military service is voluntary, with enlistment age between 18 and 24 years old and no conscription.
===Urbanization===Argentina is highly urbanized, with 92% of its population living in cities: the ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population.
About 3 million people live in the city of Buenos Aires, and including the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area it totals around 13 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world.
The population is unequally distributed: about 60% live in the Pampas region (21% of the total area), including 15 million people in Buenos Aires province.
Health care cooperatives number over 300 (of which 200 are related to labor unions) and provide health care for half the population; the national INSSJP (popularly known as PAMI) covers nearly all of the five million senior citizens.
The relatively high access to medical care has historically resulted in mortality patterns and trends similar to developed nations': from 1953 to 2005, deaths from cardiovascular disease increased from 20% to 23% of the total, those from tumors from 14% to 20%, respiratory problems from 7% to 14%, digestive maladies (non-infectious) from 7% to 11%, strokes a steady 7%, injuries, 6%, and infectious diseases, 4%.
Causes related to senility led to many of the rest.
Infant deaths have fallen from 19% of all deaths in 1953 to 3% in 2005.
The availability of health care has also reduced infant mortality from 70 per 1000 live births in 1948 to 12.1 in 2009 and raised life expectancy at birth from 60 years to 76.
Though these figures compare favorably with global averages, they fall short of levels in developed nations and in 2006, Argentina ranked fourth in Latin America.
Such positions also allowed him to play a central role in training the militia forces who repelled the Bay of Pigs Invasion and bringing the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles to Cuba which precipitated the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.
His favorite subjects in school included philosophy, mathematics, engineering, political science, sociology, history and archaeology.
They set out for Cuba on November 25, 1956.
The following day on January 2, Guevara entered Havana to take final control of the capital.
Fidel Castro took 6 more days to arrive, as he stopped to rally support in several large cities on his way to rolling victoriously into Havana on January 8, 1959.
When Hilda Gadea arrived in Cuba in late January, Guevara told her that he was involved with another woman, and the two agreed on a divorce, which was finalized on May 22.
On June 2, 1959, he married Aleida March, a Cuban-born member of the 26th of July movement with whom he had been living since late 1958.
To implement a portion of this plan, Castro named Guevara commander of the La Cabaña Fortress prison, for a five-month tenure (January 2 through June 12, 1959).
The law also stipulated that sugar plantations could not be owned by foreigners.
"In August 1961, during an economic conference of the Organization of American States in Punta del Este, Uruguay, Che Guevara sent a note of "gratitude" to United States President John F. Kennedy through Richard N. Goodwin, a young secretary of the White House.
"Guevara, who was practically the architect of the Soviet-Cuban relationship, then played a key role in bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles that precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.
A few weeks after the crisis, during an interview with the British communist newspaper the "Daily Worker", Guevara was still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal and told correspondent Sam Russell that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off.
His whereabouts were a great mystery in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself.
==Congo==In early 1965, Guevara went to Africa to offer his knowledge and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing conflict in the Congo.
He led the Cuban operation in support of the Marxist Simba movement, which had emerged from the ongoing Congo crisis.
In a speech at the 1967 International Workers' Day rally in Havana, the acting minister of the armed forces, Major Juan Almeida, announced that Guevara was "serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America".
But in August 1967, the Bolivian Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups in a violent battle, reportedly killing one of the leaders.
Debray described a destitute situation where Guevara's men suffered malnutrition, lack of water, absence of shoes, and only possessed six blankets for 22 men.
" In his homeland of Argentina, where high schools bear his name, numerous Che museums dot the country, which in 2008 unveiled a bronze statue of him in the city of his birth, Rosario.

Málaga (, ) is a municipality, capital of the Province of Málaga, in the Autonomous Community of Andalusia, Spain.
Since the publication of this book, which has rarely been out of print since his death, Nostradamus has attracted a following that, along with much of the popular press, credits him with predicting many major world events.
The resource is typically a real file on the server's secondary storage, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is implemented.
While the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients.
This feature is used for submitting web forms, including uploading of files.
* The world's first web server, later known as CERN httpd, which ran on NeXTSTEPBetween 1991 and 1994, the simplicity and effectiveness of early technologies used to surf and exchange data through the World Wide Web helped to port them to many different operating systems and spread their use among scientific organizations and universities, and then to industry.
Not only do these requests to the kernel take time, but they are not always satisfied because the system reserves resources for its own usage and has the responsibility to share hardware resources with all the other running applications.
He surrendered to British custody and spent the last six years of his life in confinement on the remote island of Saint Helena.
In April 1795, he was assigned to the Army of the West, which was engaged in the War in the Vendée—a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in Vendée, a region in west central France, on the Atlantic Ocean.
After a secret trial the Duke was executed, even though he had not been involved in the plot.
This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen.
The Russians had lost 150,000 in battle and hundreds of thousands of civilians.
For example, the websites of the Office of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the UK Statistics Authority describe the United Kingdom as being made up of four countries, one of these being Northern Ireland.
Other pages on the same websites refer to Northern Ireland specifically as a "province" as do publications of the UK Statistics Authority.
The website of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency also refers to Northern Ireland as being a province as does the website of the Office of Public Sector Information and other agencies within Northern Ireland.
Publications of HM Treasury and the Department of Finance and Personnel of the Northern Ireland Executive, on the other hand, describe Northern Ireland as being a "region of the UK".
The UK's submission to the 2007 United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names defines the UK as being made up of two countries (England and Scotland), one principality (Wales) and one province (Northern Ireland).
Unlike England, Scotland and Wales, Northern Ireland has no history of being an independent country or of being a nation in its own right.
Some writers describe the United Kingdom as being made up of three countries and one province or point out the difficulties with calling Northern Ireland a country.
Even for the period covering the first 50 years of Northern Ireland's existence, the term "country" is considered inappropriate by some political scientists on the basis that many decisions were still made in London.
Major sea ports at Larne and Belfast carry passengers and freight between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
European route E01 runs from Larne through the island of Ireland, Spain and Portugal to Seville.
The population in 2011 was 1.8 million, having grown 7.5% over the previous decade from just under 1.7 million in 2001.
This constitutes just under 3% of the population of the UK (62 million) and just over 28% of the population of the island of Ireland (6.3 million).
In 2011, 88.8% of the population were born in Northern Ireland, with 4.5% born in other parts of the United Kingdom, and 2.9% born in the Republic of Ireland.
Black people of various origins made up 0.2% of the 2011 population and people of mixed ethnicity made up 0.2%.
The largest single denomination is the Roman Catholic Church, to which 41% of the population belonged.
It is the "de facto" official language and the Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) 1737 prohibits the use of languages other than English in legal proceedings.
These operate separately under the aegis of the North/South Language Body, which reports to the North/South Ministerial Council.
The British government in 2001 ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
Irish (in Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, with a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters.
A lower level of recognition was accorded to Ulster Scots, under Part II of the Charter.
====English====The dialect of English spoken in Northern Ireland shows influence from the lowland Scots language.
However, geography is a much more important determinant of dialect than religious background.
It was spoken predominantly throughout what is now Northern Ireland before the Ulster Plantations in the 17th century and most place names in Northern Ireland are anglicised versions of a Gaelic name.
Today, the language is associated with Irish nationalism (and thus with the Catholic community).
However, in the 19th century, the language was seen as a common heritage, with Ulster Protestants playing a leading role in the Gaelic revival.
In another survey, from 1999, 1% of respondents said they spoke it as their main language at home.
The dialect spoken in Northern Ireland, Ulster Irish or Donegal Irish, is the one closest to Scottish Gaelic (which developed into a separate language from Irish Gaelic in the 17th century).
Some words and phrases are shared with Scots Gaelic, and the dialects of east Ulster – those of Rathlin Island and the Glens of Antrim – were very similar to the dialect of Argyll, the part of Scotland nearest to Northern Ireland.
Approximately 2% of the population claim to speak Ulster Scots.
====Sign languages====The most common sign language in Northern Ireland is Northern Ireland Sign Language (NISL).
Irish Sign Language (ISL) has some influence from the French family of sign language, which includes American Sign Language (ASL).
NISL takes a large component from the British family of sign language (which also includes Auslan) with many borrowings from ASL.
It is described as being related to Irish Sign Language at the syntactic level while much of the lexicon is based on British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language.
Since 1987 public houses have been allowed to open on Sundays, despite some opposition.
This is one of the four major cycles of Irish mythology.
The cycle centres on the reign of Conchobar mac Nessa, who is said to have been king of Ulster around the 1st century.
He ruled from Emain Macha (now Navan Fort near Armagh), and had a fierce rivalry with queen Medb and king Ailill of Connacht and their ally, Fergus mac Róich, former king of Ulster.
The foremost hero of the cycle is Conchobar's nephew Cúchulainn.
==Sport==In Northern Ireland, sport is popular and important in the lives of many people.
Sports tend to be organised on an all-Ireland basis and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland often field a single team.
However, the best Northern Irish players tend to play for clubs in the English or Scottish leagues.
Despite Northern Ireland's small population, its international team qualified for the World Cup in 1958, 1982 and 1986, making it to the quarter-finals in 1958 and 1982.
Ulster is one of the four professional provincial teams in Ireland and competes in the Celtic League and European Cup and won the European Cup in 1999.
In international competitions, the Ireland national rugby team recent successes include four Triple Crowns between 2004 and 2009 and a Grand Slam in 2009 in the Six Nations Championship.
====Cricket====The Ireland cricket team is an associate member of the International Cricket Council.
It participated in 2007 Cricket World Cup and qualified for the Super 8s and did the same in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20.
One of Ireland's regular international venues is Stormont in Belfast.
Of the four, football is the most popular in Northern Ireland.
The Ulster GAA is the branch of the Gaelic Athletic Association that is responsible for the nine counties of Ulster, which include the six of Northern Ireland.
Northern Ireland has contributed more major champions in the modern era than any other European country, with three in the space of just 14 months from the US Open in 2010 to the Open Championship in 2011. Notable golfers include Fred Daly (winner of The Open in 1947), Ryder Cup players Ronan Rafferty and David Feherty, leading European Tour professionals David Jones, Michael Hoey (a winner on Tour in 2011) and Gareth Maybin, as well as three recent major winners Graeme McDowell (winner of the US Open in 2010, the first European to do so since 1970), Rory McIlroy (winner of two majors) and Darren Clarke (winner of The Open in 2011).
Northern Ireland has also contributed several players to the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, including Alan Dunbar and Paul Cutler who played on the victorious 2011 team in Scotland.
Northern Ireland's golf courses include the Royal Belfast Golf Club (the earliest, formed in 1881), Royal Portrush Golf Club, which is the only course outside Great Britain to have hosted The Open Championship, and Royal County Down Golf Club ("Golf Digest" magazine's top-rated course outside the United States).
===Snooker===Northern Ireland has produced two world snooker champions; Alex Higgins, who won the title in 1972 and 1982, and Dennis Taylor, who won in 1985.
The highest-ranked Northern Ireland professional on the world circuit presently is Mark Allen from Antrim.
RTÉ, the national broadcaster of the Republic of Ireland, is available over the air to most parts of Northern Ireland via reception overspill and via satellite and cable.
As well as the standard UK-wide radio stations from the BBC, Northern Ireland is home to many local radio stations, such as Cool FM, CityBeat, and Q102.9.
People in Northern Ireland who live close to the border with the Republic of Ireland may inadvertently switch over to the Irish mobile networks, causing international roaming fees to be applied.
Northern Ireland can be called from the Republic of Ireland at trunk rates, as opposed to international rates, using the 048 prefix.

These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history.
Wales is mostly mountainous, though South Wales is less mountainous than North and mid Wales.
The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales, consisting of the coastal cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, and the South Wales Valleys to their north.
The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon () which, at , is the highest peak in Wales.
The 14, or possibly 15, Welsh mountains over 3,000 feet (914 m) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s.
The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at .
Summers are warmest in the south-east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the north.
Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.
Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.
Change did not occur in a uniform manner and the devolution of power over local government to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland means that future changes are also unlikely to be uniform.
The organisation of local government in England is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements.
Legislation concerning local government in England is the responsibility of the UK parliament and the Government of the United Kingdom, as England has no devolved parliament.
The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine Government office regions or European Union government office regions.
One region, Greater London, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a referendum.
For local government purposes, Scotland is divided into 32 council areas, with wide variation in both size and population.
The representative association of Scotland's local authorities is the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA).
Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities.
The Welsh Local Government Association represents the interests of local authorities in Wales.
On 13 March 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system.
They are the remnants of the British Empire and several have specifically voted to remain British territories (Bermuda in 1995, Gibraltar in 2002 and the Falkland Islands in 2013).
Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet, all of whom are sworn into the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, and become Ministers of the Crown.
The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 require that a new election must be called no later than five years after the previous general election.
England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK government and parliament on all issues.
The Scottish Government and Parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK parliament, including education, healthcare, Scots law and local government.
At the 2011 elections the Scottish National Party won re-election and achieved an overall majority in the Scottish parliament, with its leader, Alex Salmond, as First Minister of Scotland.
The Welsh Government and the National Assembly for Wales have more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland.
The 2011 elections resulted in a minority Labour administration led by Carwyn Jones.
Currently, Peter Robinson (Democratic Unionist Party) and Martin McGuinness (Sinn Féin) are First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively.
The UK does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly.
Today the UK has three distinct systems of law: English law, Northern Ireland law and Scots law.
A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.
The chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases, and the High Court of Justiciary, for criminal cases.
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law.
Sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury, known as sheriff solemn court, or with a sheriff and no jury, known as sheriff summary Court.
Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 48% in recorded crime from 1995 to 2007/08, according to crime statistics.
The prison population of England and Wales has almost doubled over the same period, to over 80,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000.
Crime in Scotland fell to its lowest recorded level for 32 years in 2009/10, falling by ten per cent.
At the same time Scotland's prison population, at over 8,000, is at record levels and well above design capacity.
===Foreign relations===The UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of NATO, the Commonwealth of Nations, G7, G8, G20, the OECD, the WTO, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and is a member state of the European Union.
The last time the British military fought alone was the Falklands War of 1982.
In the final quarter of 2008 the UK economy officially entered recession for the first time since 1991.
Unemployment increased from 5.2% in May 2008 to 7.6% in May 2009 and by January 2012 the unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds had risen from 11.9% to 22.5%, the highest since current records began in 1992.
The poverty line in the UK is commonly defined as being 60% of the median household income.
This is a higher level of relative poverty than all but four other EU members.
In the same year 4.0 million children, 31% of the total, lived in households below the poverty line after housing costs were taken into account.
This is a decrease of 400,000 children since 1998–1999.
The UK imports 40% of its food supplies.
Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science; from the 19th century Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory; and more recently Stephen Hawking, who has advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology, quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes.
Major scientific discoveries from the 18th century include hydrogen by Henry Cavendish; from the 20th century penicillin by Alexander Fleming, and the structure of DNA, by Francis Crick and others.
Major engineering projects and applications by people from the UK in the 18th century include the steam locomotive, developed by Richard Trevithick and Andrew Vivian; from the 19th century the electric motor by Michael Faraday, the incandescent light bulb by Joseph Swan, and the first practical telephone, patented by Alexander Graham Bell; and in the 20th century the world's first working television system by John Logie Baird and others, the jet engine by Frank Whittle, the basis of the modern computer by Alan Turing, and the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee.
Scientific research and development remains important in British universities, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry.
Between 2004 and 2008 the UK produced 7% of the world's scientific research papers and had an 8% share of scientific citations, the third and second highest in the world (after the United States and China, and the United States, respectively).
In the year from October 2009 to September 2010 UK airports handled a total of 211.4 million passengers.
In that period the three largest airports were London Heathrow Airport (65.6 million passengers), Gatwick Airport (31.5 million passengers) and London Stansted Airport (18.9 million passengers).
London Heathrow Airport, located west of the capital, has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world and is the hub for the UK flag carrier British Airways, as well as for BMI and Virgin Atlantic.
===Energy===In 2006, the UK was the world's ninth-largest consumer of energy and the 15th-largest producer.
In 2009, the UK produced 1.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil and consumed 1.7 million bbl/d.
In 2009, the UK was the 13th-largest producer of natural gas in the world and the largest producer in the EU.
Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004.
In 2005 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 171 million tons.
==Demographics==A census is taken simultaneously in all parts of the UK every ten years.
The Office for National Statistics is responsible for collecting data for England and Wales, the General Register Office for Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency each being responsible for censuses in their respective countries.
2010 was the third successive year in which natural change contributed more to population growth than net long-term international migration.
This compares to 0.3% per year in the period 1991 to 2001 and 0.2% in the decade 1981 to 1991.
It has been estimated that the number of people aged 100 or over will rise steeply to reach over 626,000 by 2080.
It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with 383 people resident per square kilometre in mid-2003, with a particular concentration in London and the south-east.
In 2012 the average total fertility rate (TFR) across the UK was 1.92 children per woman.
While a rising birth rate is contributing to current population growth, it remains considerably below the 'baby boom' peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964, below the replacement rate of 2.1, but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63.
In 2012, Scotland had the lowest TFR at only 1.67, followed by Wales at 1.88, England at 1.94, and Northern Ireland at 2.03.
===Ethnic groups===Historically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 11th century: the Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans.
Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK.
The UK has a history of small-scale non-white immigration, with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade, and the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century.
In 1950 there were probably fewer than 20,000 non-white residents in Britain, almost all born overseas.
Since 1948 substantial immigration from Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the British Empire.
30.4% of London's population and 37.4% of Leicester's was estimated to be non-white , whereas less than 5% of the populations of North East England, Wales and the South West were from ethnic minorities, according to the 2001 census.
, 26.5% of primary and 22.2% of secondary pupils at state schools in England were members of an ethnic minority.
In the 2001 Census over a fifth (21%) of the population of Wales said they could speak Welsh, an increase from the 1991 Census (18%).
In addition it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England.
In the same census in Northern Ireland 167,487 people (10.4%) stated that they had "some knowledge of Irish" (see Irish language in Northern Ireland), almost exclusively in the nationalist (mainly Catholic) population.
Over 92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2% of the population) had some Gaelic language ability, including 72% of those living in the Outer Hebrides.
It is compulsory for pupils to study a second language up to the age of 14 in England, and up to age 16 in Scotland.
French and German are the two most commonly taught second languages in England and Scotland.
All pupils in Wales are taught Welsh as a second language up to age 16, or are taught in Welsh.
The Church of England is the established church in England.
Unable to return to Poland at the end of World War II, over 120,000 Polish veterans remained in the UK permanently.
Many of these migrants came from the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent.
In 2010, there were 7.0 million foreign-born residents in the UK, corresponding to 11.3% of the total population.
Analysis of Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows that a net total of 2.3 million migrants moved to the UK in the 15 years from 1991 to 2006.
A record 241,192 people were granted permanent settlement rights in 2010, of whom 51% were from Asia and 27% from Africa.
25.5% of babies born in England and Wales in 2011 were born to mothers born outside the UK, according to official statistics released in 2012.
Citizens of the European Union, including those of the UK, have the right to live and work in any EU member state.
The UK applied temporary restrictions to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in January 2007.
Research conducted by the Migration Policy Institute for the Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009, 1.5 million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, two-thirds of them Polish, but that many subsequently returned home, resulting in a net increase in the number of nationals of the new member states in the UK of some 700,000 over that period.
The late-2000s recession in the UK reduced the economic incentive for Poles to migrate to the UK, the migration becoming temporary and circular.
In 2009, for the first time since enlargement, more nationals of the eight central and eastern European states that had joined the EU in 2004 left the UK than arrived.
In 2011, citizens of the new EU member states made up 13% of the immigrants entering the country.
The UK government has introduced a points-based immigration system for immigration from outside the European Economic Area to replace former schemes, including the Scottish Government's Fresh Talent Initiative.
In June 2010 the UK government introduced a temporary limit of 24,000 on immigration from outside the EU, aiming to discourage applications before a permanent cap was imposed in April 2011.
===Education===Education in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system.
Whilst education in England is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education, the day-to-day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of local authorities.
Education is now mandatory from ages five to sixteen (15 if born in late July or August).
The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability.
Despite a fall in actual numbers the proportion of children in England attending private schools has risen to over 7%.
Education in Scotland is the responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, with day-to-day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility of Local Authorities.
Scotland first legislated for compulsory education in 1496.
The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4%, and it has been rising slowly in recent years.
The Welsh Government has responsibility for education in Wales.
A significant number of Welsh students are taught either wholly or largely in the Welsh language; lessons in Welsh are compulsory for all until the age of 16.
There are plans to increase the provision of Welsh-medium schools as part of the policy of creating a fully bilingual Wales.
===Healthcare===Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each country has its own system of private and publicly funded health care, together with alternative, holistic and complementary treatments.
Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation.
The World Health Organization, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.
Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based, such as the Royal Colleges.
However, political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national executives; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government.
Each National Health Service has different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts.
Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly to bring it closer to the European Union average.
The UK spends around 8.4% of its gross domestic product on healthcare, which is 0.5 percentage points below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average and about one percentage point below the average of the European Union.
==Culture==The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism.
As a result of the British Empire, British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies including Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.
The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led it to be described as a "cultural superpower.
Most British literature is in the English language.
In 2005, some 206,000 books were published in the United Kingdom and in 2006 it was the largest publisher of books in the world.

In the 19th century there followed further innovation by Jane Austen, the gothic novelist Mary Shelley, the children's writer Lewis Carroll, the Brontë sisters, the social campaigner Charles Dickens, the naturalist Thomas Hardy, the realist George Eliot, the visionary poet William Blake and romantic poet William Wordsworth.
Scotland's contributions include the detective writer Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes), romantic literature by Sir Walter Scott, the children's writer J. M. Barrie, the epic adventures of Robert Louis Stevenson and the celebrated poet Robert Burns.
A more grim outlook is found in Ian Rankin's stories and the psychological horror-comedy of Iain Banks.
It was written in Cumbric or Old Welsh and contains the earliest known reference to King Arthur.
From around the seventh century, the connection between Wales and the Old North was lost, and the focus of Welsh-language culture shifted to Wales, where Arthurian legend was further developed by Geoffrey of Monmouth.
Until the late 19th century the majority of Welsh literature was in Welsh and much of the prose was religious in character.
Dylan Thomas became famous on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-20th century.
He is remembered for his poetry – his "Do not go gentle into that good night; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Golf is the sixth-most popular sport, by participation, in the UK.
===Symbols===The flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag (also referred to as the Union Jack).
It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the Flag of England on the Flag of Scotland and updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag.
Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom.
Britannia is a national personification of the United Kingdom, originating from Roman Britain.
Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a Corinthian helmet and white robes.
Since the height of the British Empire in the late 19th century, Britannia has often been associated with British maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song "Rule, Britannia!".
Up until 2008, the lion symbol was depicted behind Britannia on the British fifty pence coin and on the back of the British ten pence coin.
It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the British Army.
Large oil reserves were first identified in the Dhahran area in 1931, and in 1935, Standard Oil drilled the first commercially viable oil well.
Following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the Czech part of the former nation found itself without a common single-word name in English.
Fish is rare, with the occasional exception of fresh trout and carp, which is served at Christmas.
The first brewery is known to have existed in 1118 and the Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per capita in the world.
Apart from these and other major brands, the Czech Republic also boasts a growing number of top quality small breweries and mini-breweries seeking to continue the age-old tradition of quality and taste, whose output matches the best in the world: Štiřín, Chýně, Oslavany, Kácov.
Tourism is slowly growing around the Southern Moravian region too, which has been producing wine since the Middle Ages; about 94% of vineyards in the Czech Republic are Moravian.

In 1867, the Thai king signed a treaty with France, renouncing suzerainty over Cambodia in exchange for the control of Battambang and Siem Reap provinces which officially became part of Thailand.
The provinces were ceded back to Cambodia by a border treaty between France and Thailand in 1906.
They were wrong, however, and under the reign of King Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953.
As the Vietnam War progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of neutrality in the Cold War.

Indonesia's location on the edges of the Pacific, Eurasian, and Australian tectonic plates makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes.
Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra, and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006.
However, volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali.
Humidity is generally high, averaging about 80%.
Forests cover approximately 60% of the country.

Indonesia is one of Coral Triangle countries with the world's greatest diversity of coral reef fish with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only.
The British naturalist, Alfred Wallace, described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia's Asian and Australasian species.
In his 1869 book, "The Malay Archipelago", Wallace described numerous species unique to the area.
Indonesia's high population and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues, which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.
Issues include large-scale deforestation (much of it illegal) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; over-exploitation of marine resources; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanisation and economic development, including air pollution, traffic congestion, garbage management, and reliable water and waste water services.

Transparency International, for example, has since ranked Indonesia below 100 in its Corruption Perceptions Index.
However, as of 2012, an estimated 11.7% of the population lived below the poverty line and the official open unemployment rate was 6.1%.
==Demographics==According to the 2010 national census, the population of Indonesia is 237.6 million, with high population growth at 1.9%.
58% of the population lives in Java, the world's most populous island.
Another major grouping are Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia.
The largest ethnic group is the Javanese, who comprise 42% of the population, and are politically and culturally dominant.
Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese, and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese.
Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century, through the influence of traders, and became the country's dominant religion by the 16th century.
The TV market includes ten national commercial networks, and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI.
At a reported 25 million users in 2008, Internet usage was estimated at 12.5% in September 2009.
More than 30 million cell phones are sold in Indonesia each year, and 27% of them are local brands.
Dissatisfaction with the central government over economic and cultural issues continued to rise through the next decade, during which the Awami League emerged as the political voice of the Bengali-speaking population.
The Bangladesh Liberation War lasted for nine months.
The caretaker government worked to root out corruption from all levels of government.
In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has been called on to provide support to civil authorities for disaster relief and internal security during periods of political unrest.
Medieval Bengali literature was often either religious (for example, Chandidas), or adapted from other languages (for example, Alaol).
Bangladesh produces about 80 films a year.
=====Internal combustion engine=====The internal combustion engine is an engine in which the combustion of a fuel (generally, fossil fuel) occurs with an oxidizer (usually air) in a combustion chamber.
In 1871 Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, and in 1946 that of the Italian Republic.
In 2011, Rome was the 18th-most-visited city in the world, 3rd most visited in the European Union, and the most popular tourist attraction in Italy.
Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.
However, the power of the well known tale of Rome's legendary foundation tends to deflect attention from its actual, and much more ancient, origins.
However, under these extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture.
Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.
In this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world.
Its economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including Agostino Chigi, who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts.
The fight between France and Spain in Europe caused the first plunder of the city in more than one thousand years.
Beginning with the Council of Trent in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation as an answer to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs.
(This loss of confidence then led to major shifts of power away from the Church.
After the fall of Napoleon, the Church State under the pope was reinstated through the Congress of Vienna of 1814.
In 1849 another Roman Republic arose within the framework of the revolutions of 1848.
Rome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification, as the rest of Italy was reunited as the Kingdom of Italy, with a temporary capital at Florence.
In 1861 Rome was declared capital of Italy even though it was still under the control of the Pope.
And it was only when this was lifted in 1870, owing to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, that Italian troops were able to capture Rome entering the city through a breach near Porta Pia.
Afterwards, Pope Pius IX declared himself as prisoner in the Vatican, and in 1871 the capital of Italy was finally moved from Florence to Rome.
Soon after World War I, Rome witnessed the rise to power of Italian Fascism, led by Benito Mussolini, who marched on the city in 1922, eventually declaring a new Italian Empire and allying Italy with Nazi Germany.
The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population, which surpassed one million inhabitants.
The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the "comune" had more than 2.8 million residents; after that, population started to decline slowly as inhabitants began to move to nearby suburbs of Rome.
A new subdivision of the city under Napoleon was ephemeral, and there were no sensible changes in the organisation of the city until 1870, when Rome became the third capital of Italy.
At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati – the only one outside the Walls of Pope Urban VIII – in 1921).
The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the Tiber Island, the only natural ford of the river in this area.
Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the Aniene, which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.
The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from above sea level (at the base of the Pantheon) to above sea level (the peak of Monte Mario).
Rome outgrew the Servian Wall, but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor Aurelian began building the Aurelian Walls.
These were almost long, and were still the walls the troops of the Kingdom of Italy had to breach to enter the city in 1870.
In the coldest month – January, the average temperature is during the day and at night.
The average relative humidity is 75%, varying from 72% in July to 77% in November.
At the time of the Emperor Augustus, Rome was the largest city in the world: with a population of about one million people (about the size of London in the early 19th century, when London was the largest city in the world).
The Fascist regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city, but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s.
After the Second World War, growth continued, helped by a post-war economic boom.
In mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2 million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800inhab./km2 stretching over more than 5,000 km²).
Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76 percent.
This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners).
The average age of a Roman resident is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42.
In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Rome grew by 6.54 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent.
The current birth rate of Rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.
Despite some interruptions (such as the Avignon papacy), Rome has for centuries been the home of the Roman Catholic Church and the Bishop of Rome, otherwise known as the Pope.
The area was part of the Roman rione of Borgo until 1929.
*1822 – The Florida Territory is created in the United States.
*1841 – The National Bank of Greece is founded in Athens.
In the most serious, the so-called 12-3 incident, 6 people were killed and more than 200 people were injured.
In 2006, the airport handled about 5 million passengers.
The Lunar Chinese New Year is the most important traditional festival and celebration normally takes place in late January or early February.
Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel (; March 18, 1858September 29, 1913) was a German inventor and mechanical engineer, famous for the invention of the diesel engine.
In the San Francisco Bay area the first baptisms occurred at Mission San Francisco in 1777.
Mongolia (Mongolian: , "" and , "Mongol Uls") is a landlocked country in east-central Asia.
Ulaanbaatar, the capital and also the largest city, is home to about 45% of the population.
Mongolia's political system is a parliamentary republic.
The area of what is now Mongolia has been ruled by various nomadic empires, including the Xiongnu, the Xianbei, the Rouran, the Turkic Khaganate, and others.
After the breakdown of communist regimes in Europe in late 1989, Mongolia saw its own peaceful democratic revolution in early 1990; it led to a multi-party system, a new constitution of 1992, and transition to a market economy.
Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade regimes.
But the U.S. Department of State Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs uses the United Nations (UN) estimations instead of the U.S. Census Bureau estimations.
Mongolia's population growth rate is estimated at 1.2% (2007 est.).
About 59% of the total population is under age 30, 27% of whom are under 14.
This relatively young and growing population has placed strains on Mongolia's economy.
Since the end of socialism, Mongolia has experienced a decline of total fertility rate (children per woman) that is steeper than in any other country in the world, according to recent UN estimations: in 1970–1975, fertility was estimated to be 7.33 children per woman, dropping to about 2.1 in 2000–2005.
Recently, however, that trend has been stopped, so in 2005–2010 period, the estimated fertility value has actually increased to 2.5 and stabilised afterwards at the rate of about 2.2–2.3 children per woman.
Ethnic Mongols account for about 95% of the population and consist of Khalkha and other groups, all distinguished primarily by dialects of the Mongol language.
The Khalkha make up 86% of the ethnic Mongol population.
=== Languages ===The official language of Mongolia is Mongolian, and is spoken by 95% of the population.
A variety of dialects of Oirat and Buryat are spoken across the country, and there are also some speakers of Mongolic Khamnigan.
In the west of the country, Kazakh and Tuvan, both Turkic languages, are also spoken.
Today, Mongolian is written using the Cyrillic alphabet, although in the past it was written using the Mongolian script.
An official reintroduction of the old script was planned for 1994, but has not taken place as older generations encountered practical difficulties.
The traditional alphabet is being slowly reintroduced through schools.
A number of older educated Mongolian citizens speak some German, as they studied in the former East Germany, while a few speak other languages from the former Eastern Bloc.
Many younger people are fluent in the Western European languages as they study or work in, among other places, Germany, France and Italy.
Besides mining (21.8% of GDP) and agriculture (16% of GDP), dominant industries in the composition of GDP are wholesale and retail trade and service, transportation and storage, and real estate activities.
The grey economy is estimated to be at least one-third the size of the official economy.
As of 2006, 68.4% of Mongolia's exports went to the PRC, and the PRC supplied 29.8% of Mongolia's imports.
Mongolia is ranked as lower middle income economy by the World Bank.
22.4% of the population lives on less than US$1.25 a day.
Despite growth, the proportion of the population below the poverty line was estimated to be 35.6% in 1998, 36.1% in 2002–2003, 32.2% in 2006.
Because of a boom in the mining sector, Mongolia had high growth rates in 2007 and 2008 (9.9% and 8.9%, respectively).
In 2009, sharp drops in commodity prices and the effects of the global financial crisis caused the local currency to drop 40% against the U.S. dollar.
However, inflation continued to erode GDP gains, with an average rate of 12.6% expected in Mongolia at the end of 2011.
Mongolia made a significant improvement on the ease of doing business in 2012, moving up to rank 76 compared with 88 last year in the "Doing Business" report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
Mining is continuing to rise as a major industry of Mongolia as evidenced by number of Chinese, Russian and Canadian firms starting mining business in Mongolia.
In summer 2009, the government negotiated an "Investment Agreement" with Rio Tinto and Ivanhoe Mines to develop the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold deposit, the biggest foreign-investment project in Mongolia, expected to account for one-third of Mongolia's GDP by 2020.
In March 2011, six big mining companies prepared to bid for the Tavan Tolgoi area, the world's largest untapped coal deposit.
According to Erdenes MGL, the government body in-charge of Tavan Tolgoi, ArcelorMittal, Vale, Xstrata, U.S. coal miner Peabody, a consortium of Chinese energy firm Shenhua and Japan's Mitsui & Co, and a separate consortium of Japanese, South Korean and Russian firms are the preferred bidders.
=== Agriculture ===In 2002, about 30% of all households in Mongolia lived from breeding livestock.
Most herders in Mongolia follow a pattern of nomadic or semi-nomadic pastoralism.
Due to the severe 2009–2010 winter, Mongolia lost 9.7 million animals, or 22% of total livestock.
This immediately affected meat prices, which increased twofold; GDP dropped 1.6% in 2009.
In the past it was known by the Russian term "yurt", but this is changing as the Mongolian term becomes better known among English-speaking countries.
According to Mongolian artist and art critic N. Chultem, the "ger" was the basis for development of traditional Mongolian architecture.
In the 16th and 17th centuries, lamaseries were built throughout the country.
Many of them started as "ger"-temples.
Further enlargement led to a quadratic shape of the temples.
Chultem distinguished three styles in traditional Mongolian architecture: Mongolian, Tibetan and Chinese as well as combinations of the three.
The temple Lavrin (18th century) in the Erdene Zuu lamasery was built in the Tibetan tradition.
An example of a temple built in the Chinese tradition is the lamasery Choijing Lamiin Sume (1904), which is a museum today.
The temple of Maitreya (disassembled in 1938) is an example of the Tibeto-Mongolian architecture.
The traditional music includes a variety of instruments, famously the morin khuur, and also the singing styles like the urtyn duu ("long song"), and throat-singing (khoomei).
The "tsam" is danced to keep away evil spirits and it was seen the reminiscences of shamaning.
The first rock band of Mongolia was Soyol Erdene, founded in the 1960s.
It was followed by Mungunhurhree, Ineemseglel, Urgoo, etc., carving out the path for the genre in the harsh environment of Communist ideology.
Mungunhurhree and Haranga were to become the pioneers in the Mongolia's heavy rock music.
Haranga approached its zenith in the late 1980s and 1990s.
The leader of Haranga, famous guitarist Enh-Manlai, generously helped the growth of the following generations of rockers.
Among the followers of Haranga was the band Hurd.
By that time, the environment for development of artistic thought had become largely liberal thanks to the new democratic society in the country.
The 1990s saw development of rap, techno, hip-hop and also boy bands and girl bands flourish at the turn of the millennium.
Until reforms in the 1990s, the government had strict control of the media and oversaw all publishing, in which no independent media was allowed.
The dissolution of the Soviet Union had a significant impact on Mongolia, where the one-party state grew into a multi-party democracy, and with that, media freedoms came to the forefront.
A new law on press freedom, drafted with help from international NGOs on August 28, 1998 and enacted on January 1, 1999, paved the way for media reforms.
The Mongolian media currently consists of around 300 print and broadcasting outlets.
Since 2006, the media environment has been improving with the government debating a new Freedom of Information Act, and the removal of any affiliation of media outlets with the government.
Market reforms have led to an increasing number of people working in the media year on year, along with students at journalism schools.
In its 2013 World Press Freedom Index report, Reporters Without Borders classified the media environment as 98th out of 179, with 1st being most free.
In modern-day Mongolia, Nadaam is held on July 11 to July 13 in the honour of the anniversaries of the National Democratic Revolution and foundation of the Great Mongol State.
Another very popular activity called Shagaa is the "flicking" of sheep ankle bones at a target several feet away, using a flicking motion of the finger to send the small bone flying at targets and trying to knock the target bones off the platform.
At Naadam, this contest is very popular and develops a serious audience among older Mongolians.
Horse riding is especially central to Mongolian culture.
The long-distance races that are showcased during Naadam festivals are one aspect of this, as is the popularity of trick riding.
One example of trick riding is the legend that the Mongolian military hero Damdin Sükhbaatar scattered coins on the ground and then picked them up while riding a horse at full gallop.
Mongolian wrestling is the most popular of all Mongol sports.
It is the highlight of the Three Manly Games of Naadam.
Hundreds of wrestlers from different cities and aimags around the country take part in the national wrestling competition.
Association football is also played in Mongolia.
The Mongolia Premier League is the top domestic competition.
Several Mongolian women have excelled in pistol shooting: Otryadyn Gündegmaa is a silver medalist of the 2008 Olympic Games, Munkhbayar Dorjsuren is a double world champion and Olympic bronze medal winner (now representing Germany), while Tsogbadrakhyn Mönkhzul is, as of May 2007, ranked third in the world in the 25 metre pistol event.
Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country by land area and the ninth largest country in the world; its territory of is larger than Western Europe.
Grain, potatoes, vegetables, melons and livestock are the most important agricultural commodities.
Chief livestock products are dairy products, leather, meat, and wool.
Wheat exports, a major source of hard currency, rank among the leading commodities in Kazakhstan's export trade.
In 2003 Kazakhstan harvested 17.6 million tons of grain in gross, 2.8% higher compared to 2002.
Kazakh agriculture still has many environmental problems from mismanagement during its years in the Soviet Union.
Some Kazakh wine is produced in the mountains to the east of Almaty.
Development of petroleum, natural gas, and mineral extractions, such as potassium, has attracted most of the over $40 billion in foreign investment in Kazakhstan since 1993 and accounts for some 57% of the nation's industrial output (or approximately 13% of gross domestic product).
According to some estimates, Kazakhstan has the second largest uranium, chromium, lead, and zinc reserves, the third largest manganese reserves, the fifth largest copper reserves, and ranks in the top ten for coal, iron, and gold.
It is also an exporter of diamonds.
Oil explorations have shown that the deposits on the Caspian shore are only a small part of a much larger deposit.
It is said that 3.5 billion tons of oil and 2.5 trillion cubic meters of gas could be found in that area.
Overall the estimate of Kazakhstan's oil deposits is 6.1 billion tons.
These are not capable of processing the total crude output so much of it is exported to Russia.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration Kazakhstan was producing approximately of oil per day in 2009.
===Banking===The banking industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan has experienced a pronounced boom and bust cycle over 2000s decade.
After several years of rapid expansion in the mid-2000s, the banking industry collapsed in 2008.
Although the Russian and Kazakh banking systems share several common features, there are also some fundamental differences.
Banks in Kazakhstan have experienced a lengthy period of political stability and economic growth.
Together with a rational approach to banking and finance policy, this has helped push Kazakhstan’s banking system to a higher level of development.
Banking technology and personnel qualifications alike are stronger in Kazakhstan than in Russia.
On the negative side, past stability in Kazakhstan arose from the concentration of virtually all political power in the hands of a single individual – the key factor in any assessment of system or country risk.
The potential is there for serious disturbances if and when authority passes into new hands.
Official estimates put the population of Kazakhstan at 16.455 million as of February 2011, of which 46% is rural and 54% is urban.
In 2013, Kazakhstan's population rose to 17,280,000 with a 1.7% growth rate over the past year according to the Kazakhstan Statistics Agency.
The 2009 population estimate is 6.8% higher than the population reported in the last census from January 1999.
The decline in population that began after 1989 has been arrested and possibly reversed.
Men and women make up 48.3% and 51.7% of the population, respectively.
Some minorities such as Germans (1.1%) (Germans who had previously settled in Russia, especially Volga Germans), Ukrainians, Koreans, Chechens, Meskhetian Turks, and Russian political opponents of the regime had been deported to Kazakhstan in the 1930s and 1940s by Stalin; some of the bigger Soviet labour camps (Gulag) existed in the country.
Significant Russian immigration also connected with Virgin Lands Campaign and Soviet space program during the Khrushchev era.
In 1989, ethnic Russians were 37.8% of the population and Kazakhs held a majority in only 7 of the 20 regions of the country.
Before 1991 there were one million Germans in Kazakhstan; most of them emigrated to Germany following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Most members of the smaller Pontian Greek minority have emigrated to Greece.
In the late 1930s thousands of Koreans in the Soviet Union were deported to Central Asia.
These people are now known as Koryo-saram.
The 1990s were marked by the emigration of many of the country's Russians and Volga Germans, a process that began in the 1970s.
This has made indigenous Kazakhs the largest ethnic group.
Additional factors in the increase in the Kazakh population are higher birthrates and immigration of ethnic Kazakhs from China, Mongolia, and Russia.
Education across Kazakhstan is conducted in either Kazakh, Russian, or both.
===Religion===According to the 2009 Census, 70% of the population is Muslim, 26% Christian, 0.1% Buddhists, 0.2% others (mostly Jews), and 3% Irreligious, while 0.5% chose not to answer.
In November 2012, 183 members of the United Nations General Assembly elected Kazakhstan to serve a three-year term on the Human Rights Council, the United Nations key forum for tackling entrenched human rights concerns around the world.
In 2009, Kazakhstan published a National Human Rights Action Plan.
With support from the U.S. Department of State's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL), the American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative opened a media support center in Almaty to bolster free expression and journalistic rights in Kazakhstan.
==Rule of Law==ABA Rule of Law Initiative<br>The ABA Rule of Law Initiative (ABA ROLI) opened its first Kazakhstan office in the city of Almaty in 1993 and is currently based in Astana.
Since then, ABA ROLI has had offices in Shymkent and Oskemen.
Kazakhstan’s Supreme Court has taken recent steps to modernize and to increase transparency and oversight over the country’s legal system.
With funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, the ABA Rule of Law Initiative began a new program in April 2012 to strengthen the independence and accountability of Kazakhstan’s judiciary.
The Procurator General of Kazakhstan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation collaborated in a complex seven-year investigation into an 11 February 2006 triple homicide of Altynbek Sarsenbayev, Baurzhan Baibosyn, and Vasiliy Zhuravlev.
The ranking American diplomat in Kazakhstan, Ambassador John Ordway, praised in a press conference the "exceptional cooperation between Kazakhstani and American law enforcement.
===Cuisine===In the national cuisine, livestock meat can be cooked in a variety of ways and is usually served with a wide assortment of traditional bread products.
A traditional Kazakh dinner involves a multitude of appetisers on the table, followed by a soup and one or two main courses such as pilaf and beshbarmak.
They also drink their national beverage, which consists of fermented mare's milk.
Kazakhstan is host of the International Astana Action Film Festival and the Eurasian Film Festival held annually.
Hollywood director Timur Bekmambetov is from Kazakhstan and has become active in bridging Hollywood to the Kazakhstan film industry.
(The national language, Kazakh, is related to the other Turkic languages, with which it shares cultural and historical ties.

This was by far the largest battle of the Napoleonic Wars and cost more than 90,000 casualties in total.
Napoleon arrived in Paris on 20 March and governed for a period now called the Hundred Days.

Augustus (; 23 September 63 BC – 19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Empire and its first Emperor, ruling from 27 BC until his death in 14 AD.
In 59 BC, when he was four years old, his father died.
In 52 or 51 BC, Julia Caesaris died.
While in Egypt, Antony had been engaged in an affair with Cleopatra and had fathered three children with her.
* Lynch, John.
Faraday ultimately became the first and foremost Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, a lifetime position.
In 1847 he discovered that the optical properties of gold colloids differed from those of the corresponding bulk metal.
Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park", he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.
He also studied qualitative analysis, and conducted chemical experiments on the train until an accident prohibited further work of the kind.
These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including General Electric, which is still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.
One night in 1867, he was working with a lead–acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor.
One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home.
Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that some of her symptoms sounded as if they were associated with morphine poisoning.
Mina outlived Thomas Edison, dying on August 24, 1947.
Edison became known as "The Wizard of Menlo Park," New Jersey.
Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction.
However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device.
In his first year, the plant under General Manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps.
Nearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature.
About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14-year period.
The first successful test was on October 22, 1879; it lasted 13.5 hours.
The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present-day state of Wyoming, where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29, 1878, from the Continental Divide.
Latimer worked as an engineer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights.
On October 8, 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison's patent was based on the work of William Sawyer and was therefore invalid.
In September 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of the theatre.
The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station, New York City.
It was on September 4, 1882, that Edison switched on his Pearl Street generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers in lower Manhattan.
Earlier in the year, in January 1882, he had switched on the first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London.
In 1885, Thomas Edison had bought property in Fort Myers, Florida, and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat.
This fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984.
In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, "correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.
" She also said that during one of his periodic "great scientific adventures", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.
Edison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906.
==Death==Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, "Glenmont" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina.
Mina died in 1947.
The Philadelphia City Council named Edison the recipient of the John Scott Medal in 1889.
In 1899, Edison was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of The Franklin Institute.
In 1927, he was granted membership in the National Academy of Sciences.
In 2008, Edison was inducted in the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started full membership negotiations with the European Union in 2005.
The first major empire in the area was founded by the Hittites, from the 18th through the 13th century BC.
Turkey remained neutral during most of World War II, but entered the closing stages of the war on the side of the Allies on 23 February 1945.
After participating with the United Nations forces in the Korean War, Turkey joined NATO in 1952, becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the Mediterranean.
Universal suffrage for both sexes has been applied throughout Turkey since 1933, and every Turkish citizen who has turned 18 years of age has the right to vote.
Human rights in Turkey have been the subject of some controversy and international condemnation.
Between 1998 and 2008 the European Court of Human Rights made more than 1,600 judgements against Turkey for human rights violations, particularly regarding the right to life, and freedom from torture.
Other issues, such as Kurdish rights, women's rights, and press freedom, have also attracted controversy.
Turkey's human rights record continues to be a significant obstacle to future membership of the EU.

By 1775, Africans made up 20% of the population in the American colonies, which made them the second largest ethnic group after the English.
In 1860, at the start of the Civil War, the African-American population had increased to 4.4 million, but the percentage rate dropped to 14% of the overall population of the country.
By 1900, the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million.
At the time of the 2000 Census, 54.8% of African Americans lived in the South.
According to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.05% of African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin, many of whom may be of Brazilian, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Cuban, Haitian, or other Latin American descent.
Chicago has the second largest black population, with almost 1.6 million African Americans in its metropolitan area, representing about 18 percent of the total metropolitan population.
Other large cities with African-American majorities include New Orleans, Louisiana (60%), Baltimore, Maryland (63%) Atlanta, Georgia (54%, see African Americans in Atlanta), Memphis, Tennessee (61%), and Washington, D.C. (50.7%).
Within that county, among the wealthiest communities are Glenn Dale, Maryland and Fort Washington, Maryland.
Queens County, New York is the only county with a population of 65,000 or more where African Americans have a higher median household income than White Americans.
Of the total number of Jehovah's Witnesses, 22% are black.
Historically, between 15 to 30% of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas were Muslims, but most of these Africans were converted to Christianity during the era of American slavery.
However during the 20th century, some African Americans converted to Islam, mainly through the influence of black nationalist groups that preached with distinctive Islamic practices; these include the Moorish Science Temple of America, though the largest organization was the Nation of Islam, founded during the 1930s, which attracted at least 20,000 people as of 1963, prominent members included activist Malcolm X and boxer Muhammad Ali.
However, few members rejected these changes, in particular Louis Farrakhan, who revived the Nation of Islam in 1978 based on its original teachings.
The Amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world, about , and accounts for approximately one-fifth of the world's total river flow.
The quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to in the rainy season, with an average of from 1973 to 1990.
The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous Amazon rainforest.
The lower Amazon seems to have once been a gulf of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos.
Only about ten percent of the Amazon's water enters downstream of Óbidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley.
In the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as Monte Alegre.
These hills are cut down to a kind of terrace which lies between them and the river.
The tucuxi ("Sotalia fluviatilis"), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon basin and in the coastal waters of South America.
For instance the pre-Columbian culture on the island of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people.
The total population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about two-thirds comprised by Europeans and slaves, the slaves amounting to about 25,000.
The town of Manáos, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 to 1,500.
This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.
The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.
Four centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than , excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters.
This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.
In 1960, the construction of the new capital city of Brasília in the interior also contributed to the opening up of the Amazon basin.
==Dispute regarding length==While debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest.
A study by Brazilian scientists concluded that the Amazon is actually longer than the Nile.
Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told the Brazilian TV network Globo in June 2007 that it could be considered as a fact that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.
The highest point on the Equator is at the elevation of , at , found on the southern slopes of Volcán Cayambe in Ecuador.
Usually, average annual temperature is around during the day and at night.
In November 1821, at the age of 15, he was admitted to Florence Academy of Fine Arts as its youngest student, where he studied chemical and mechanical engineering.
== Electromagnetic telephone ==Meucci studied the principles of electromagnetic voice transmission for many years and was able to realize his dream of transmitting his voice through wires in 1856.
===2BSD (PDP-11)===The Second Berkeley Software Distribution (2BSD), released in May 1979, included updated versions of the 1BSD software as well as two new programs by Joy that persist on Unix systems to this day: the vi text editor (a visual version of ex) and the C shell.
Later releases of 2BSD contained ports of changes to the VAX-based releases of BSD back to the PDP-11 architecture.
===3BSD===A VAX computer was installed at Berkeley in 1978, but the port of Unix to the VAX architecture, UNIX/32V, did not take advantage of the VAX's virtual memory capabilities.
The kernel of 32V was largely rewritten by Berkeley students to include a virtual memory implementation, and a complete operating system including the new kernel, ports of the 2BSD utilities to the VAX, and the utilities from 32V was released as 3BSD at the end of 1979.
", wrote:===4.1BSD===4.1BSD (June 1981) was a response to criticisms of BSD's performance relative to the dominant VAX operating system, VMS.
The 4.1BSD kernel was systematically tuned up by Bill Joy until it could perform as well as VMS on several benchmarks.
Its main changes were to improve the performance of many of the new contributions of 4.2BSD that had not been as heavily tuned as the 4.1BSD code.
Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing.
Christian rap is currently the most commercially successful form of religious rap.
Out of 190,638 households, 29.9% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.5% were married couples living together, 24.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.3% were nonfamilies.
35.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.1% had someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older.
The average household size was 2.44 and the average family size was 3.19.
The population was spread out with 28.5% under the age of 18, 9.5% from 18 to 24, 30.4% from 25 to 44, 19.0% from 45 to 64, and 12.5% who are 65 years of age or older.
The median age was 33 years.
For every 100 females there were 90.0 males.
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.2 males.
26.3% of the population and 22.9% of families were below the poverty line.
Out of the total population, 37.6% of those under the age of 18 and 16.8% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.
It is written, spoken and used in all provinces/territories of Pakistan despite the fact that the people from differing provinces may have different indigenous languages, as from the fact that it is the "base language" of the country.
It is absorbing many words from the regional languages of Pakistan.
So although most of the population is conversant in Urdu, it is the first language of only an estimated 7% of the population who are mainly Muslim immigrants (known as Muhajir in Pakistan) from different parts of South Asia.
There are millions of Pakistanis whose native language is not Urdu, but because they have studied in Urdu medium schools, they can read and write Urdu along with their native language.
Most of the nearly five million Afghan refugees of different ethnic origins (such as Pashtun, Tajik, Uzbek, Hazarvi, and Turkmen) who stayed in Pakistan for over twenty-five years have also become fluent in Urdu.
In India, Urdu is spoken in places where there are large Muslim minorities or cities that were bases for Muslim Empires in the past.
Indian madrasahs also teach Arabic as well as Urdu.
It is distinct by its mixture of vocabulary from Marathi and Konkani, as well as some vocabulary from Arabic, Persian and Turkish that are not found in the standard dialect of Urdu.
A number of daily newspapers and several monthly magazines in Urdu are published in these states.
There are also a smaller number of borrowings from Chagatai, Portuguese, and more recently English.
Many of the words of Arabic origin have been adopted through Persian and have different pronunciations and nuances of meaning and usage than they do in Arabic.
== Writing system ===== Urdu script ===Urdu is written right-to left in an extension of the Persian alphabet, which is itself an extension of the Arabic alphabet.
Until the late 19th century, all proceedings and court transactions in this register of Urdu were written officially in the Persian script.
Roman Urdu has been used since the days of the British Raj, partly as a result of the availability and low cost of Roman movable type for printing presses.
The use of Roman Urdu was common in contexts such as product labels.
Habib R. Sulemani says,"The younger generation of Urdu-speaking people around the world, especially Pakistan, are using Romanised Urdu on the Internet and it has become essential for them, because they use the Internet and English is its language.
Typically, in that sense, a person from Islamabad in Pakistan may chat with another in Delhi in India on the Internet only in Roman Urdū.
Moreover, the younger generation of those who are from the English medium schools or settled in the west, can speak Urdu but can’t write it in the traditional Arabic script and thus Roman Urdu is a blessing for such a population.
Thus Roman Urdū was a common way of writing among Pakistani and Indian Christians in these areas up to the 1960s.
The Bible Society of India publishes Roman Urdū Bibles that enjoyed sale late into the 1960s (though they are still published today).
Church songbooks are also common in Roman Urdū.
However, the usage of Roman Urdū is declining with the wider use of Hindi and English in these states.
Microsoft has included Urdu language support in all new versions of Windows and both Windows Vista and Microsoft Office 2007 are available in Urdu through Language Interface Pack support.

The tattoo art was a sacred marker of identity among the Maori and also referred to as a vehicle for storing one's tapu, or spiritual being, in the afterlife.
Over time tattoos have become increasingly popular in the U.S., and according to a study in 2006; nearly 25 percent of Americans between the ages of eighteen and fifty have one or more tattoos.
The most common method of tattooing in modern times is the electric tattoo machine, which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle or a group of needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit.
The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles in and out of the skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second.
The equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use.
In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work.
In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky.
A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature.
In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectricity, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which nerve cells passed signals to the muscles.
The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances.
A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface.
The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand.
While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere.
The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it.
This relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821.
A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury.
Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced.
Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current.
He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation.
The United States showed a 12% increase in demand during each year of the first three decades of the twentieth century, a rate of growth that is now being experienced by emerging economies such as those of India or China.
Historically, the growth rate for electricity demand has outstripped that for other forms of energy.
Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting.
A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of electric heating in new buildings.
Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a share of the market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process.
Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure.
The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.
Faraday answered, “One day sir, you may tax it.”In the 19th and early 20th century, electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world.

Aluminium atoms are arranged in a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure.
Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of 26Al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation 4.55 billion years ago.
====Aluminium(I)====AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium.
The great majority of this material is converted to metallic aluminium.
Aluminium sulfate (Al2(SO4)3·(H2O)18) is produced on the annual scale of several billions of kilograms.
About half of the production is consumed in water treatment.
It is also used as a mordant, in fire extinguisher, as a food additive, in fireproofing, and in leather tanning.
Aluminium ammonium sulfate, which is also called ammonium alum, (NH4)Al(SO4)2·12H2O, is used as a mordant and in leather tanning.
The consumption of both alums is declining.
Aluminium borate (Al2O3·B2O3) is used in the production of glass and ceramics.
Aluminium fluorosilicate (Al2(SiF6)3) is used in the production of synthetic gemstones, glass and ceramic.
Aluminium phosphate (AlPO4) is used in the manufacture: of glass and ceramic, pulp and paper products, cosmetics, paints and varnishes and in making dental cement.
Héroult's process was in production by 1889 in Switzerland at Aluminium Industrie, now Alcan, and at British Aluminium, now Luxfer Group and Alcoa, by 1896 in Scotland.
Information engineering (IE) or information engineering methodology (IEM) is a software engineering approach to designing and developing information systems.
Each of these inventions is consistent with the modern definition of engineering, exploiting basic mechanical principles to develop useful tools and objects.

For a simplified notion of a wormhole, visualize space as a two-dimensional (2D) surface.
For example, instead of circular holes on a 2D plane, the entry and exit points could be visualized as spheres in 3D space.
Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.
In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or Chamberland-Pasteur filter) with pores smaller than bacteria.
At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium – this was part of the germ theory of disease.
Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate.
Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension.
Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals.
Another breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilized chickens' eggs.
This work enabled Jonas Salk to make an effective polio vaccine.
The tobacco mosaic virus was the first to be crystallised and its structure could therefore be elucidated in detail.
On the basis of her pictures, Rosalind Franklin discovered the full structure of the virus in 1955.
The second half of the 20th century was the golden age of virus discovery and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years.
In 1963, the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first retrovirus.
== Origins ==Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved.
In general, viruses are much smaller than bacteria.
Most viruses that have been studied have a diameter between 20 and 300 nanometres.
This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.
There are millions of different types of viruses, although only about 5,000 of them have been described in detail.
A virus has either a DNA or an RNA genome and is called a DNA virus or an RNA virus, respectively.
Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell.
Beyond this limit, errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive.
The life cycle of viruses differs greatly between species but there are six "basic" stages in the life cycle of viruses:Attachment is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface.
Other viruses, such as rabies virus, can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range.
Viruses must generate mRNAs from their genomes to produce proteins and replicate themselves, but different mechanisms are used to achieve this in each virus family.
Many serious diseases such as Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses.
There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.
To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered.
Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms.
It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated to be close to 70% of the indigenous population.
A pandemic is a worldwide epidemic.
Most researchers believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century; it is now a pandemic, with an estimated 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide.
The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognised on 5 June 1981, making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.
Marburg virus, first discovered in 1967, attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in Angola.
Viral cancers occur only in a minority of infected persons (or animals).
The development of cancer is determined by a variety of factors such as host immunity and mutations in the host.
The most recently discovered human cancer virus is a polyomavirus (Merkel cell polyomavirus) that causes most cases of a rare form of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma.
Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer.
Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).
When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces.
The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralizing viruses but is produced by the cells of the immune system only for a few weeks.
The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past.
=== Prevention and treatment ===Because viruses use vital metabolic pathways within host cells to replicate, they are difficult to eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general.
Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine.
The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.
Other antiviral drugs in use target different stages of the viral life cycle.
In 80% of people infected, the disease is chronic, and without treatment, they are infected for the remainder of their lives.
The treatment of chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed.
One of the most effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes.
Within a short amount of time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein.
These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis.
Bacteria also contain a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of RNA interference.
These viruses have been studied in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales.
=== Weapons ===The ability of viruses to cause devastating epidemics in human societies has led to the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare.
The smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication.
Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded.
Other poets completed the "epic cycle", but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely.
Thus Greek mythology unfolds as a phase in the development of the world and of humans.
In Germany, by about 1795, there was a growing interest in Homer and Greek mythology.
* L. Burn, "Greek Myths", 75</ref> From the early years of Renaissance, artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, portrayed the Pagan subjects of Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes.

Separate colonies were carved from parts of New South Wales: South Australia in 1836, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859.
The indigenous population, estimated to have been between 750,000 and 1,000,000 at the time European settlement began, declined for 150 years following settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.
The Federal Capital Territory (later renamed the Australian Capital Territory) was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of Canberra.

The Italian manuscript has 506 pages, of which the Gospel of Barnabas fills pages 43 to 500, written within red frames in an Islamic style.
The preceding pages 5 to 42 are also red framed; but remain blank (other than for Cramer's presentation to Prince Eugene), and it may be inferred that some sort of preface or preliminary text was intended, although the space is much greater than would have been needed for the text of the corresponding Spanish Preface.
Its binding is Turkish, and appears to be original; but the paper has an Italian watermark, which has been dated between 1563 and 1620.
The writer is not a professional scribe.
The linguistic experts consulted by the Raggs concluded that the Vienna manuscript was most likely the work of an older Venetian scribe, copying a Tuscan original, and writing in the second half of the 16th century.
Apart from the surviving Sydney transcript, the Spanish text survives in three passages quoted by Sale in Spanish, and in nine chapters quoted by White in English translation.
The Sydney transcript has 130 pages, but does not contain the entire text, as at the bottom of page 116 there is a note "Cap 121 to 200 wanting", and page 117 resumes at chapter 200 (in the Spanish numeration).
Comparing the Sydney transcript with the counterpart passages quoted in Spanish by Sale, there are no substantial differences, but it would appear that sometime between Sale's death in 1736 and 1745 some 80 chapters of the Spanish manuscript were lost.
Other researchers have noted a range of textual similarities between passages in the Gospel of Barnabas, and variously the texts of a series of late medieval vernacular harmonies of the four canonical gospels (in Middle English and Middle Dutch, but especially in Middle Italian); which are all speculated as deriving from a lost Vetus Latina version of the Diatessaron of Tatian .
If true, this would also support an Italian origin.
These scholars note parallels with a series of Morisco forgeries, the Lead Books of Sacromonte, dating from the 1590s; or otherwise with Morisco reworkings of Christian and Islamic traditions, produced following the expulsion of the Moriscos from Spain.
A detailed comparison between the surviving Italian and Spanish texts shows numerous places where the Spanish reading appears to be secondary, as for example, where a word or phrase necessary for the meaning is missing in the Spanish text but present in the Italian.
Joosten, however, while accepting that the carelessness of the English scribe is the most likely explanation for most such instances, nevertheless argues that a minority of such readings are inherently more likely to be due to translation errors in the Spanish text.
In particular, he sees the Spanish text as containing numerous 'Italicisms' as, for example, where the Italian text employs the conjunction "pero", with an Italian meaning 'therefore'; while the Spanish text also reads "pero", with a Spanish meaning 'however'; the Italian sense being the one demanded by the context.
There are, however, other passages where the Spanish reading makes sense, while the Italian does not, and many features of the Italian text that are not found in the Spanish; such as the titles for chapters 1–27.
Few academics argue that the text, in its present form, dates back any earlier than the 14th–16th centuries; although a minority see it as containing portions of an earlier work, and almost all would detect the influence of earlier sources—over and above the Vulgate text of the Latin Bible.
Consequently most researchers would concur with a stratification of the surviving text into at least three distinct layers of composition:* an editorial layer dating from the late 16th century; and comprising, at the least, the Spanish preface and the Arabic annotations,* a layer of vernacular narrative composition, either in Spanish or Italian, and dating from no earlier than the mid-14th century,* a layer derived from earlier source materials, almost certainly transmitted to the vernacular author/translator in Latin; and comprising, at the least, those extensive passages in the Gospel of Barnabas that closely parallel pericopes in the canonical gospels; but whose underlying text appears markedly distinct from that of the late medieval Latin Vulgate (as for instance in the alternative version of the Lord's Prayer in chapter 37, which includes a concluding doxology, contrary to the Vulgate text, but in accordance with the Diatessaron and many other early variant traditions);Much of the controversy and dispute concerning the authenticity of the Gospel of Barnabas can be re-expressed as debating whether specific highly transgressive themes (from an orthodox Christian perspective) might already have been present in the source materials utilised by a 14th–16th-century vernacular author, whether they might be due to that author himself, or whether they might even have been interpolated by the subsequent editor.
Those researchers who regard these particular themes as primitive, nevertheless do not generally dispute that other parts of the Gospel may be late and anachronistic; while those researchers who reject the authenticity of these particular themes do not generally dispute that other parts of the Gospel could be transmitting variant readings from antiquity.

By the close of the century, autonomy for Ireland within the United Kingdom, known as "Home Rule", was regarded as highly likely.
In response, opponents to Home Rule, from Conservative and Unionist Party leaders such as Andrew Bonar Law and Dublin-based barrister Sir Edward Carson to militant unionists in Ireland, threatened the use of violence.
Unionists were in a minority on the island of Ireland as a whole, but in the northern province of Ulster they were a very large majority in County Antrim and County Down, small majorities in County Armagh and County Londonderry and a substantial minority in the rest of the province.
Most of the remaining 26 counties which later became the Republic of Ireland were overwhelmingly majority-nationalist.
The war was expected to last only a few weeks but in fact lasted four years.
Public opinion in the majority "nationalist" community (who sought greater independence from Britain) had shifted during the war from a demand for home rule to one for full independence.
In 1919, David Lloyd George proposed a new bill which would divide Ireland into two Home Rule areas: twenty-six counties being ruled from Dublin and six being ruled from Belfast.
Straddling these two areas would be a shared Lord Lieutenant of Ireland who would appoint both governments and a Council of Ireland, which Lloyd George believed would evolve into an all-Ireland parliament.
Events had however overtaken the government.
Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland in 1921 under the terms of Lloyd George's Government of Ireland Act 1920 during the Anglo-Irish War between Irish republican and British forces.
At the conclusion of that war on 6 December 1922, under the terms of the resulting treaty, Northern Ireland provisionally became an autonomous part of the newly independent Irish Free State, with the right to opt out of it.
===Northern Ireland===As expected, the Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland resolved on 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State) to make the following address to the King to exercise, within the one month allowed, the right to opt out of the Irish Free State: "Most Gracious Sovereign, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922, being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland".
Owing to the outbreak of civil war in the Free State, the work of the commission was delayed until 1925.
Leaders in Dublin expected a substantial reduction in the territory of Northern Ireland, with nationalist areas moving to the Free State.
In June 1940, to encourage the neutral Irish state to join with the Allies, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill indicated to the Taoiseach Éamon de Valera that the United Kingdom would push for Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer.
The British did not inform the Government of Northern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Dublin government, and De Valera's rejection was not publicised until 1970.
The Ireland Act 1949 gave the first legal guarantee that the region would not cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.
However NICRA's campaign, and the reaction to it, proved to be a precursor to a more violent period.
Alongside the violence, there was a political deadlock between the major political parties in Northern Ireland, including those who condemned violence, over the future status of Northern Ireland and the form of government there should be within Northern Ireland.
In 1973, Northern Ireland held a referendum to determine if it should remain in the United Kingdom, or be part of a united Ireland.
The new Articles 2 and 3, added to the Constitution to replace the earlier articles, implicitly acknowledge that the status of Northern Ireland, and its relationships within the rest of the United Kingdom and with Ireland, would only be changed with the agreement of a majority of voters in both jurisdictions (Ireland voting separately).
At the same time, the British Government recognised for the first time, as part of the prospective, the so-called "Irish dimension": the principle that the people of the island of Ireland as a whole have the right, without any outside interference, to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.
These institutions were suspended by the British Government in 2002 after Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) allegations of spying by people working for Sinn Féin at the Assembly (Stormontgate).
On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA declared an end to its campaign and has since decommissioned what is thought to be all of its arsenal.
Politicians elected to the Assembly at the 2003 Assembly election were called together on 15 May 2006 under the Northern Ireland Act 2006 for the purpose of electing a First Minister of Northern Ireland and a deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland and choosing the members of an Executive (before 25 November 2006) as a preliminary step to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland.
Following the election held on 7 March 2007, devolved government returned to Northern Ireland on 8 May 2007 with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley and Sinn Féin deputy leader Martin McGuinness taking office as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively.
==Politics=====Background===The main political divide in Northern Ireland is between Unionists or Loyalists, who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and Nationalists or Republicans, who wish to see Northern Ireland join the rest of Ireland, independent from the United Kingdom.
Some Unionists argue that any discrimination was not just due to religious or political bigotry, but also the result of more complex socio-economic, socio-political and geographical factors.
The political unrest went through its most violent phase between 1968 and 1994.
According to a 2009 opinion poll, 69% express longterm preference of the maintenance of Northern Ireland's membership of the United Kingdom (either directly ruled or with devolved government), while 21% express a preference for membership of a united Ireland.
This discrepancy can be explained by the overwhelming preference among Protestants to remain a part of the UK (91%), while Catholic preferences are spread across a number of solutions to the constitutional question including remaining a part of the UK (47%), a united Ireland (40%), Northern Ireland becoming an independent state (5%), and those who "don't know" (5%).
Official voting figures, which reflect views on the "national question" along with issues of candidate, geography, personal loyalty and historic voting patterns, show 54% of Northern Ireland voters vote for Pro-Unionist parties, 42% vote for Pro-Nationalist parties and 4% vote "other".
Most of the population of Northern Ireland are at least nominally Christian.
For the most part, Protestants feel a strong connection with Great Britain and wish for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Many Catholics however, generally aspire to a United Ireland or are less certain about how to solve the constitutional question.
In the 2009 survey by Northern Ireland Life and Times, 47% of Northern Irish Catholics supported Northern Ireland remaining a part of the United Kingdom, either by direct rule (8%) or devolved government (39%).
Protestants have a slight majority in Northern Ireland, according to the latest Northern Ireland Census.
The make-up of the Northern Ireland Assembly reflects the appeals of the various parties within the population.
===Governance===Since 1998, Northern Ireland has devolved government within the United Kingdom.
Reserved matters are a list of policy area (such as civil aviation, units of measurement, and human genetics), which Parliament may devolve to Northern Ireland Assembly at some time in future.
On all other matters, the Northern Ireland Executive together with the 108-member Northern Ireland Assembly may legislate and govern for Northern Ireland.
Devolution in Northern Ireland is dependent upon participation by members of the Northern Ireland executive in the North/South Ministerial Council, which co-ordinates areas of co-operation (such as agriculture, education and health) between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly are by single transferable vote with six representatives (Member of the Legislative Assembly, MLAs) elected from 18 parliamentary constituencies.
However, not all of these take their seats.
Northern Ireland itself forms a single constituency for elections to the European Union.
Northern Ireland law developed from Irish law that existed before the partition of Ireland in 1921.
Northern Ireland is a common law jurisdiction and its common law is similar to that in England and Wales.
However, there are some important differences in law and procedure between Northern Ireland and England and Wales.
The body of statute law affecting Northern Ireland reflects the history of Northern Ireland, including Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the former Parliament of Northern Ireland and the Parliament of Ireland, along with some Acts of the Parliament of England and of the Parliament of Great Britain that were extended to Ireland under Poynings' Law between 1494 and 1782.
This does not however account for the complex identities within Northern Ireland, given that many of the population regard themselves as "Ulster" or "Northern Irish", either as a primary or secondary identity.
Compared to a similar survey carried out in 1998, this shows a fall in the percentage of Protestants identifying as British and Ulster, and a rise in those identifying as Northern Irish.
The 2008 survey found that 61% of Catholics described themselves as Irish, with 25% identifying as Northern Irish, 8% as British and 1% as Ulster.
People born in Northern Ireland are, with some exceptions, deemed by UK law to be citizens of the United Kingdom.
They are also, with similar exceptions, entitled to be citizens of Ireland.
Both governments exclude some people born in Northern Ireland, in particular persons born without one parent who is a British or Irish citizen.
The position in UK nationality law is that most of those born in Northern Ireland are UK nationals, whether or not they so choose.
The centrepiece of Northern Ireland's geography is Lough Neagh, at the largest freshwater lake both on the island of Ireland and in the British Isles.
A second extensive lake system is centred on Lower and Upper Lough Erne in Fermanagh.
The largest island of Northern Ireland is Rathlin, off the north Antrim coast.
None of the hills are especially high, with Slieve Donard in the dramatic Mournes reaching , Northern Ireland's highest point.
Also in north Antrim are the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, Mussenden Temple and the Glens of Antrim.
The Lower and Upper River Bann, River Foyle and River Blackwater form extensive fertile lowlands, with excellent arable land also found in North and East Down, although much of the hill country is marginal and suitable largely for animal husbandry.
The weather is unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America.
The damp climate and extensive deforestation in the 16th and 17th centuries resulted in much of the region being covered in rich green grassland.
These counties are no longer used for local government purposes; instead there are twenty-six districts of Northern Ireland which have different geographical extents, even in the case of those named after the counties from which they derive their name.
Fermanagh District Council most closely follows the borders of the county from which it takes its name.
Most districts are based around large towns, for instance Coleraine Borough Council derives its name from the town of Coleraine in County Londonderry.
Although counties are no longer used for governmental purpose, they remain a popular means of describing where places are.
The name of county then appears in both Irish and English on the passport's information page, as opposed to the town or city of birth on the United Kingdom passport.
The original system of car registration numbers largely based on counties still remains in use.
The Union Jack and the former Northern Ireland flag are flown in some loyalist areas, and the Tricolour, adopted by republicans as the flag of Ireland in 1916, is flown in some republican areas.
The official flag is that of the state having sovereignty over the territory, i.e.
The former Northern Ireland flag, also known as the "Ulster Banner" or "Red Hand Flag", is a banner derived from the coat of arms of the Government of Northern Ireland until 1972.
Since 1972, it has had no official status.
This red saltire on a white field was used to represent Ireland in the flag of the United Kingdom.
It is still used by some British army regiments.
Foreign flags are also found, such as the Palestinian flags in some Nationalist areas and Israeli flags in some Unionist areas.
The United Kingdom national anthem of "God Save the Queen" is often played at state events in Northern Ireland.
Major Gaelic Athletic Association matches are opened by the Irish national anthem, "Amhrán na bhFiann (The Soldier's Song)", which is also used by most other all-Ireland sporting organisations.
The Irish national anthem is also played at Dublin home matches, being the anthem of the host country.
The division in nomenclature is sometimes seen in the names of organisations associated with one or other of the main communities, but there are numerous exceptions.
In Gaelic games, followed mainly by nationalists, the GAA county is "Derry", but in sports followed mainly by unionists, clubs tend to avoid the use of "Londonderry" in favour of more precise locales (Glendermott Cricket Club) or neutral terms (Foyle Hockey Club).
"Derry" is also used in the names of both the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic dioceses, and by one of the largest Protestant fraternal societies, the Apprentice Boys of Derry.
There is no agreement on how to decide on a name.
The Queen has not intervened on the matter and thus the council is now called the Derry City Council while the city is still officially Londonderry.
The choice of term can be controversial and can reveal the writer's political preferences.
This has been noted as a problem by several writers on Northern Ireland, with no generally recommended solution.
There is also no uniform or guiding way to refer to Northern Ireland amongst the agencies of the UK government.
